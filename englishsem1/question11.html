      Q11. What are some <strong>do’s</strong> and <strong>don’ts</strong> of debate and discussion?
    </div>

    <!-- ANSWER STARTS -->

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Debate and discussion are two important forms of oral communication included in the
      Ability Enhancement Course. Debate is more formal and competitive, while discussion is
      more cooperative and exploratory. However, in both activities, the success of the event
      does not depend only on knowledge of the topic; it also depends on the <span class="highlight">
      behaviour</span> and <span class="highlight">conduct</span> of the participants. Certain
      practices are recommended and should be followed – these are the <em>do’s</em> – and certain
      habits must be avoided – these are the <em>don’ts</em>. A student who observes these
      guidelines will create a positive impression on judges, teachers and fellow students.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">I. General Do’s Common to Debate and Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      Some basic do’s apply to both debate and discussion because both are forms of structured
      communication.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Be well-prepared:</span>
        Read about the topic in advance, note down important facts, examples and arguments, and
        arrange them logically. Preparation gives confidence and prevents hesitation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Listen attentively:</span>
        Pay close attention to what others are saying. Good listening allows you to respond
        meaningfully instead of repeating the same points.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Be polite and respectful:</span>
        Use courteous forms of address, maintain a calm tone and show respect even when you
        disagree with someone’s views.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Speak clearly and audibly:</span>
        Pronounce words correctly, use simple sentences and ensure that your voice reaches the
        entire audience without shouting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Stay on the topic:</span>
        Keep your contribution related to the motion or point under discussion. Irrelevant
        remarks create confusion and waste time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Use facts and examples:</span>
        Support your statements with reasons, data, illustrations or short examples; this makes
        your contribution convincing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Control your emotions:</span>
        Speak firmly but calmly. Do not allow anger, irritation or over-excitement to disturb
        your performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Observe basic etiquette:</span>
        Switch off mobile phones or keep them silent, avoid whispering, and maintain eye
        contact with speakers.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">II. General Don’ts Common to Debate and Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      Just as there are positive behaviours to be cultivated, there are also negative habits to
      be avoided.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t interrupt rudely:</span>
        Avoid cutting across another speaker’s sentence. If you must intervene, do it politely,
        for example, “Excuse me, may I add a point here?”
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t make personal attacks:</span>
        Criticise ideas, not individuals. Avoid remarks about a person’s background, accent,
        appearance or ability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t shout or argue aggressively:</span>
        Raising the volume does not strengthen your argument. It only shows lack of control and
        may reduce your marks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t dominate the floor:</span>
        Do not speak for an excessive amount of time or prevent others from speaking. Group
        activities require equal opportunity for all.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t ignore the chairperson or moderator:</span>
        Always follow instructions about time limits, order of speaking and procedure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t use abusive or sarcastic language:</span>
        Harsh words or mocking comments spoil the atmosphere and show immaturity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t appear careless:</span>
        Avoid slouching, looking uninterested, playing with pen or mobile, or talking to your
        neighbour while others are speaking.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">III. Do’s in a Debate</h2>
    <p>
      A debate is a formal activity where two sides argue for and against a motion. The
      following do’s are particularly important for debate.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Do understand the motion clearly:</span>
        Before preparing, analyse the exact wording of the motion. Be sure of what is included
        and what is excluded. This prevents misunderstanding of the topic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Do prepare a strong opening and closing:</span>
        Begin with a clear statement of your stand (“I rise to speak for/against the motion…”)
        and end with a brief, powerful conclusion summarising your main points.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Do organise arguments logically:</span>
        Arrange your points in a proper order – introduction, main arguments, evidence and
        conclusion. Each point should follow naturally from the previous one.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Do anticipate counter-arguments:</span>
        Think of what the other side may say and prepare replies in advance. This will
        strengthen your confidence during rebuttal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Do use appropriate formal expressions:</span>
        In a debate, it is good to address “Mr./Madam Chairperson, honourable judges, my worthy
        opponents, dear audience”. This shows awareness of the formal setting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Do maintain team coordination:</span>
        If it is a team debate, distribute points among team members and avoid unnecessary
        repetition. Listen to your own side as carefully as to the opposite side.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Do rebut politely:</span>
        While answering the other side, use expressions like, “My learned opponent has argued
        that… however, I would like to point out…”. This maintains a respectful tone even in
        disagreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Do keep to the time limit:</span>
        Practise your speech in advance with a watch. Finishing within time creates an
        impression of discipline and control.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">IV. Don’ts in a Debate</h2>
    <p>
      Certain mistakes are frequently observed in student debates. These should be avoided.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t speak without preparation:</span>
        Reading a few lines just before the debate is not enough. Poor preparation leads to
        repetition, confusion and weak arguments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t depend entirely on memorised speech:</span>
        Learn your structure, but be flexible. If you only repeat memorised lines and ignore the
        other side’s points, the debate becomes mechanical.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t misquote facts or statistics:</span>
        Using wrong figures or invented stories reduces your credibility. It is better to use a
        few reliable facts than many doubtful ones.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t distort the opponent’s argument:</span>
        Represent the other side fairly before you attack it. Examiners notice when a speaker
        deliberately misrepresents what was said.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t insult or ridicule:</span>
        Statements like “Only a foolish person will say this” should never be used. They weaken
        your own position and may lead to negative marking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t ignore the audience:</span>
        Avoid speaking only to the judges or only to your notes. Look at the audience from time
        to time; after all, you are trying to persuade them.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">V. Do’s in a Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      A discussion is usually less formal and more cooperative than a debate. The main aim is
      to understand the topic and, if possible, reach a common conclusion. The following do’s
      are important in discussions, including group discussions used in selection interviews.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Do encourage participation:</span>
        Give others a chance to speak. Invite quieter members by asking for their views: “What
        do you think about this point?”
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Do build on others’ ideas:</span>
        Begin with phrases like “Adding to what she said…” or “I would like to extend this
        point…”. This shows cooperative attitude.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Do summarise from time to time:</span>
        When the discussion becomes long, someone may help by briefly summarising what has been
        said so far and suggesting the next direction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Do remain open-minded:</span>
        Be willing to modify your view if strong reasons are presented by others. Discussion is
        about learning, not about stubbornly sticking to a position.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Do focus on solving the problem:</span>
        Especially in case-study or problem-based discussions, try to move towards practical
        solutions instead of only criticising the situation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Do use cooperative language:</span>
        Expressions like “we may consider…”, “our group feels…”, “one possible solution is…”
        reflect team spirit.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">VI. Don’ts in a Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      Certain behaviours can easily spoil the quality of a discussion and must be avoided.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t treat discussion as a personal battle:</span>
        The aim is not to defeat others but to understand the issue. Avoid stubborn arguing only
        to prove that you are right.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t speak for the sake of speaking:</span>
        Examiners can see when a participant talks without adding any new idea. Quality of
        contribution is more important than quantity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t form sub-groups:</span>
        Whispering separately to your neighbour or starting a side conversation divides the
        group and looks disrespectful.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t reject others’ ideas rudely:</span>
        Instead of saying “This is nonsense”, use expressions like “I have a different opinion”
        or “I see some difficulty with this suggestion…”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t change the topic unnecessarily:</span>
        Jumping from one issue to another prevents the group from reaching any conclusion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Don’t display negative body language:</span>
        Rolling eyes, laughing at others’ mistakes or continuously checking your phone sends a
        wrong message to the group.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To conclude, both <span class="highlight">debate</span> and <span class="highlight">
      discussion</span> require not only knowledge of the subject but also disciplined behaviour
      and good manners. The <em>do’s</em> include preparation, attentive listening, clarity of
      speech, politeness, logical argument, respect for time and encouragement of others. The
      <em>don’ts</em> include interrupting rudely, shouting, making personal attacks, dominating
      the conversation, ignoring the moderator, using abusive language and showing careless body
      language. A student who follows these guidelines will perform well in classroom activities,
      examinations, group discussions and professional meetings, and will be recognised as a
      confident and cultured communicator.
