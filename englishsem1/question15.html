      Q15. What is an <strong>interview</strong>? Discuss its <strong>objectives</strong>, 
      <strong>types</strong> and <strong>essential skills for success</strong>.
    </div>

    <!-- ANSWER STARTS -->

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In modern academic and professional life, the interview has become one of the most important
      tools for selection and evaluation. Admission to courses, appointment to jobs, promotion,
      scholarship and even some types of research all make use of interviews. For a student of
      the Ability Enhancement Course, a clear understanding of interview and its essential skills
      is necessary because the interview is often the final stage between education and employment.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Meaning of Interview</h2>
    <p>
      The word <span class="highlight">interview</span> literally means “a meeting face to face”.
      In the context of communication, an interview may be defined as:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>“A planned, face-to-face (or sometimes technology-mediated) conversation between two or
      more persons, in which one party asks questions and the other answers, with the specific
      purpose of obtaining information, assessing suitability or taking a decision.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually there are two sides:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the <span class="highlight">interviewer</span> or interview panel, and</li>
      <li>the <span class="highlight">interviewee</span> or candidate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unlike casual conversation, the interview is formal, purposeful and guided by a definite
      agenda, such as selecting the best candidate for a job or seat.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Objectives of an Interview</h2>
    <p>
      The interview serves several important objectives, both for the organisation and for the
      candidate.
    </p>

    <h3>1. To Obtain First-Hand Information</h3>
    <p>
      Through an interview, the organisation obtains fresh, first-hand information about the
      candidate’s qualifications, experience, knowledge, personality and attitude. Written
      documents like application forms and certificates tell only part of the story; the
      interview allows deeper insight.
    </p>

    <h3>2. To Assess Suitability</h3>
    <p>
      One main objective is to judge whether the candidate is suitable for the particular course
      or job. The interview helps to evaluate:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>subject knowledge and general awareness,</li>
      <li>communication skills, especially listening and speaking,</li>
      <li>confidence, initiative and leadership qualities, and</li>
      <li>values, behaviour and ability to work in a team.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. To Clarify Details and Remove Doubts</h3>
    <p>
      An interview provides an opportunity to clarify any doubtful points in the application
      form, such as gaps in education or changes in career. The candidate can also ask questions
      about the organisation, job profile or course structure.
    </p>

    <h3>4. To Provide Information and Create a Good Image</h3>
    <p>
      From the organisation’s side, the interview is also a chance to give accurate information
      about its expectations, policies and work culture. A well-conducted interview creates a
      positive image of the institution in the mind of candidates, even if they are not selected.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Types of Interviews</h2>
    <p>
      Interviews can be classified in different ways. In the context of the Ability Enhancement
      Course, the following types are especially relevant.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Selection or Job Interview</h3>
    <p>
      This is the most common type. Candidates are interviewed for appointment to a new job or
      for campus placement. The focus is on checking qualifications, technical knowledge,
      communication skills, confidence and suitability for the position.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Admission or Academic Interview</h3>
    <p>
      For admission to certain professional courses, colleges and universities conduct interviews
      to judge the candidate’s motivation, academic interests and preparedness for the course.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Promotion and Appraisal Interview</h3>
    <p>
      Employees already working in an organisation may be interviewed for promotion or
      performance appraisal. Here the emphasis is on review of past performance, strengths,
      weaknesses and future potential.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Exit Interview</h3>
    <p>
      When an employee resigns or leaves a job, some organisations conduct an exit interview to
      understand reasons for leaving and to get feedback about working conditions and policies.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Counselling or Guidance Interview</h3>
    <p>
      In schools, colleges and counselling centres, interviews may be used to understand the
      personal or academic problems of students and to guide them appropriately. The tone here
      is more supportive and empathetic than evaluative.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Telephonic and Online Interviews</h3>
    <p>
      With the growth of technology, many preliminary interviews are conducted through
      telephone, video calls or online platforms. The basic principles remain the same, but the
      candidate must pay extra attention to voice clarity, camera position and technical
      readiness.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Stages of an Interview</h2>
    <p>
      For the candidate, the interview experience can be divided into three main stages.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Pre-interview Stage (Preparation)</h3>
    <p>
      Before entering the interview room, effective candidates complete certain important
      preparations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>collect information about the organisation and the position,</li>
      <li>revise subject knowledge and recent developments,</li>
      <li>prepare a clear self-introduction and review their own CV, and</li>
      <li>arrange documents neatly and dress suitably for the occasion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. During the Interview</h3>
    <p>
      This stage covers the actual face-to-face interaction:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>entering the room with confidence and greeting the panel,</li>
      <li>taking the seat only when invited,</li>
      <li>listening carefully to questions and answering them clearly and honestly,</li>
      <li>maintaining polite language, eye contact and positive body language, and</li>
      <li>thanking the panel at the end.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Post-interview Stage</h3>
    <p>
      After the interview, responsible candidates:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>review their own performance to note strengths and weaknesses,</li>
      <li>complete any follow-up, such as sending documents if requested, and</li>
      <li>wait patiently for the result without unnecessary anxiety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Essential Skills for Success in Interviews</h2>
    <p>
      Certain key skills greatly increase the chances of success in interviews. These skills are
      a natural extension of listening and speaking skills studied in the Ability Enhancement
      Course.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Planning and Self-awareness</h3>
    <p>
      A good interview performance begins with <span class="highlight">self-awareness</span>.
      The candidate should have a clear idea of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>personal strengths and weaknesses,</li>
      <li>short-term and long-term goals,</li>
      <li>reasons for choosing a particular course or career, and</li>
      <li>skills and achievements that are relevant to the position.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This clarity helps in giving confident and consistent answers.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Verbal Communication Skills</h3>
    <p>
      The ability to use language effectively is central to interview success.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Clarity:</span>
        Answers should be direct and to the point, avoiding long, confusing sentences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Appropriate vocabulary:</span>
        Standard, polite English is preferred; slang and very casual expressions should be avoided.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Logical organisation:</span>
        Points should be arranged in a logical order, for example, past → present → future or
        reason → example → result.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Listening Skills</h3>
    <p>
      An interview is not a one-sided speech. Effective candidates listen carefully to the exact
      wording of questions before answering. Good listening prevents misunderstanding and allows
      the candidate to respond to what is actually asked, not to what is imagined.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Non-verbal Communication</h3>
    <p>
      Interviewers form impressions not only from words but also from <span class="highlight">
      body language</span>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Neat and appropriate dress conveys seriousness and respect for the occasion.</li>
      <li>Entering with a gentle smile, offering a polite greeting and sitting straight suggest
        confidence.</li>
      <li>Eye contact with different members of the panel shows attentiveness and honesty.</li>
      <li>Avoiding restless movements, crossing arms tightly or playing with pens prevents
        negative impressions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Honesty and Positive Attitude</h3>
    <p>
      Interviewers usually value <span class="highlight">honesty</span> and a 
      <span class="highlight">positive attitude</span> more than artificial perfection.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Admitting honestly when one does not know an answer is better than guessing wildly.</li>
      <li>Speaking respectfully about previous institutions, teachers or employers reflects good character.</li>
      <li>Presenting weaknesses along with efforts to improve them shows maturity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Ability to Answer Common Questions</h3>
    <p>
      Certain questions frequently appear in interviews, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Tell us something about yourself.”</li>
      <li>“Why do you want to join this course/company?”</li>
      <li>“What are your strengths and weaknesses?”</li>
      <li>“Where do you see yourself after five years?”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Preparing thoughtful answers to such questions in advance helps the candidate to speak
      confidently and avoid nervous silence.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Asking Relevant Questions</h3>
    <p>
      At the end of an interview, candidates are sometimes invited to ask questions. Intelligent,
      relevant questions show genuine interest and awareness. For example, asking about training
      opportunities, future growth or specific responsibilities gives a good impression. On the
      other hand, questions only about salary or holidays at the first stage may appear immature.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Time Management and Courtesy</h3>
    <p>
      Punctuality is an essential interview skill. Reaching the venue before time, switching off
      the phone, waiting patiently and speaking politely to office staff all contribute to the
      final impression. A courteous “Thank you for giving me this opportunity” at the end
      completes the interview gracefully.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Do’s and Don’ts for Candidates (Brief Summary)</h2>
    <p>
      For quick revision, the essentials may be summarised as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Do</span> collect information, prepare and practise.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Do</span> dress neatly, be punctual and carry necessary documents.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Do</span> listen carefully, answer clearly and maintain eye contact.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Do</span> remain calm, honest and courteous throughout.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Don’t</span> argue, boast or criticise previous institutions.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Don’t</span> tell lies, exaggerate achievements or memorise artificial speeches.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Don’t</span> appear overconfident, casual or careless in dress and manner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To sum up, an <span class="highlight">interview</span> is a planned, purposeful conversation
      between interviewer and candidate, designed to obtain information and judge suitability for
      admission, employment or promotion. It serves multiple objectives: collecting first-hand
      data, assessing personality and communication skills, clarifying doubts and presenting the
      organisation’s image. Interviews may be of many types – selection, admission, appraisal,
      exit, counselling, telephonic or online – but all require similar communication skills. For
      success, candidates need careful preparation, clear and honest answers, attentive listening,
      positive body language, polite behaviour and thoughtful self-presentation. Mastery of these
      interview skills, as emphasised in the Ability Enhancement Course, opens the door from the
      classroom to the world of work and greatly increases the chances of academic and
      professional success.
