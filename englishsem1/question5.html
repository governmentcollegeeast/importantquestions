    <!-- ANSWER STARTS -->

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      English words are made up of a sequence of vowel and consonant sounds. Among the vowel
      sounds, two important categories are <span class="highlight">monophthongs</span> and
      <span class="highlight">diphthongs</span>. The prescribed book on “Language Skills –
      Listening and Speaking” gives special attention to these because a clear understanding of
      them helps students to pronounce English words correctly and to hear the differences
      between similar sounding words. Examiners expect candidates not only to know the
      definitions, but also to understand the basic nature, types and importance of
      monophthongs and diphthongs.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Monophthongs (Pure Vowels)</h2>
    <p>
      The word <span class="highlight">monophthong</span> comes from two Greek words:
      <em>mono</em> (single) and <em>phthong</em> (sound). Monophthongs are therefore
      <span class="highlight">single, pure vowel sounds in which the tongue remains more or less
      steady and does not glide towards another vowel position</span>. The sound quality at the
      beginning and at the end of the vowel remains the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the vowel sounds in words like “sit”, “seat”, “cat”, “cup”, “full” and
      “food” are all monophthongs. When we pronounce such sounds carefully, we notice that our
      tongue and lips do not move from one position to another; they stay almost fixed for the
      duration of the vowel.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub">1. Characteristics of Monophthongs</h3>
    <p>
      Monophthongs in English have the following important characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Single steady quality:</span> The sound is uniform throughout;
        it does not change in quality while it is being pronounced.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Produced with one tongue position:</span> The tongue is placed
        at a particular height and part of the mouth and remains there without any noticeable
        glide.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">May be short or long:</span> Some monophthongs are short (as in
        “bit”, “put”), while others are relatively long (as in “beat”, “food”). Length
        differences can sometimes change meaning, so they are important for learners.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Form the core of syllables:</span> Every syllable in English
        must contain a vowel, and very often this vowel is a monophthong. Thus monophthongs play
        a central role in the structure of words.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="sub">2. Classification of Monophthongs</h3>
    <p>
      Linguists classify monophthongs mainly on the basis of three factors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Height of the tongue</span> in the mouth – close (high), half-close,
        half-open or open (low). The vowel in “see” is close, while the vowel in “cat” is open.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Part of the tongue raised</span> – front, central or back. The vowel in
        “sit” is a front vowel; in “cut” it is central; in “put” it is back.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Lip position</span> – rounded, spread or neutral. Many back vowels such as
        those in “got” and “food” are produced with rounded lips, while front vowels like the
        one in “see” are produced with spread lips.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Students are not required to memorise a full chart, but they should realise that the
      shape and position of the tongue and lips decide which monophthong is heard by the
      listener.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub">3. Importance of Monophthongs for Learners</h3>
    <p>
      Monophthongs are particularly important for Indian learners of English because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Many Indian languages do not have the same set of vowel sounds as English. As a result,
        students may replace English monophthongs with nearest sounds from their mother tongue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Small differences in monophthongs can change meanings, for example, “ship/sheep”,
        “full/fool”, “pull/pool”. Understanding monophthongs helps in avoiding such confusing
        errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Correct production of monophthongs gives a more natural rhythm to English speech and
        makes it easier for others to understand.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Diphthongs (Gliding Vowels)</h2>
    <p>
      The word <span class="highlight">diphthong</span> is also Greek in origin and means
      literally “double sound”. A diphthong is
      <span class="highlight">a complex vowel sound which begins as one vowel and glides
      smoothly towards another within the same syllable</span>. What we hear is one combined
      sound, but inside it there is a movement of the tongue from a starting position to an
      ending position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simple examples of diphthongs in English can be found in words such as “time”, “boy”,
      “now”, “day”, “go”, “here” and “there”. When we pronounce these words slowly, we can feel
      that the tongue is not fixed; it travels from one vowel area to another while the sound is
      being produced.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub">1. Characteristics of Diphthongs</h3>
    <p>
      Important characteristics of diphthongs are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Glide between two vowel positions:</span> The sound begins in
        the quality of one vowel and ends in the quality of another, usually in the direction of
        /i/ or /u/-type positions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Single syllabic sound:</span> Although there is movement, a
        diphthong functions as one vowel within a syllable. For example, the word “time”
        contains just one syllable, not two.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Change in tongue and sometimes lip position:</span> The glide
        involves a clear shift in the position of the tongue and often a slight change in lip
        rounding.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Longer in duration:</span> Diphthongs are generally longer than
        short monophthongs because of the movement from one position to another.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="sub">2. Types of Diphthongs</h3>
    <p>
      For convenience, English diphthongs are often grouped into two broad classes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">a) Closing diphthongs</span><br>
        In these diphthongs, the glide moves towards a closer (higher) vowel position such as
        /i/ or /u/. Examples (shown here only by words, not symbols) include the diphthong in:
        <ul>
          <li>“time”, “buy”, “light” – starting from an open or mid position and moving towards
          an /i/-like end,</li>
          <li>“go”, “home”, “no” – moving towards a /u/-like end,</li>
          <li>“boy”, “noise” – starting from a back position and gliding towards a front high
          position.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">b) Centring diphthongs</span><br>
        In these, the glide moves towards a central, neutral vowel like the one we hear in
        “about”. Examples can be recognised in words such as “here”, “there”, “poor” in many
        accents of English. The glide in these cases tends to move towards the central region of
        the mouth.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The exact number of diphthongs may vary slightly between different descriptions of
      English, but the basic idea of a gliding vowel remains the same.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub">3. Importance of Diphthongs for Learners</h3>
    <p>
      Diphthongs present special difficulties for learners because many Indian languages do not
      have the same type of vowel glides. Students often replace English diphthongs with simple
      vowels or with two separate vowels, which affects the natural rhythm of English speech.
      Some common problems are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pronouncing “time” almost like “taam” with a long single vowel instead of a glide.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pronouncing “go” as “goh-oo”, inserting an extra syllable instead of one smooth diphthong.
      </li>
      <li>
        Confusing diphthongs in pairs like “coat/caught” or “beer/bear” depending on the local
        accent.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Systematic practice in listening to and producing diphthongs helps learners to overcome
      such habits and to approach a more standard pattern of English pronunciation.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Difference between Monophthongs and Diphthongs</h2>
    <p>
      The essential differences between the two may be summarised as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Number of vowel qualities:</span>
        A monophthong has one unchanging quality; a diphthong combines two vowel qualities in a
        single movement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Movement of the tongue:</span>
        In a monophthong, the tongue stays steady; in a diphthong, the tongue clearly glides
        from one position to another.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Length and complexity:</span>
        Monophthongs are generally simpler and may be short or long; diphthongs are relatively
        longer and more complex because of the glide.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Role in teaching:</span>
        Monophthongs provide the basic vowel framework of the language, while diphthongs add
        variety and flexibility. Both must be mastered for accurate pronunciation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To conclude, <span class="highlight">monophthongs</span> are pure, steady vowel sounds
      produced with a single tongue position, whereas <span class="highlight">diphthongs</span>
      are gliding vowels which move from one vowel quality to another within the same syllable.
      Together they form the heart of the English vowel system. For students of the Ability
      Enhancement Course, understanding these two categories is not a matter of theory alone; it
      directly improves listening, pronunciation and spoken fluency. Regular practice of
      monophthongs and diphthongs, as suggested in the prescribed Unimax textbook, enables
      learners to approach a clear and acceptable standard of English speech and prepares them
      well for academic as well as professional communication.
