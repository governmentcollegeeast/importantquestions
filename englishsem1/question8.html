    <!-- ANSWER STARTS -->

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      English spelling is often confusing. The same letter can represent different sounds
      (“a” in “cat”, “call”, “any”), and the same sound can be written in different ways (“f”
      sound in “fun”, “phone”, “laugh”). For a student of spoken English, ordinary spelling
      does not give a reliable picture of pronunciation. To solve this problem, linguists have
      developed a special, scientific system of symbols to represent speech sounds. This system
      is called the <span class="highlight">International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The IPA is very important in the Ability Enhancement Course because it provides a common,
      standard way of showing how words are actually pronounced, independent of traditional
      spelling or local accent.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Meaning of International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</h2>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight">International Phonetic Alphabet</span> is a
      <span class="highlight">set of special symbols used to represent the sounds of all human
      languages accurately and consistently</span>. Each symbol stands for one distinct speech
      sound, known as a <em>phoneme</em>. In the IPA:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>one symbol always represents the same sound, and</li>
      <li>each sound has one fixed symbol.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For example, in English dictionaries, the word “cat” is written using IPA symbols to show
      its exact pronunciation, and the word “caught” is written with a different symbol to show
      that its vowel sound is not the same as in “cat”, even though both words begin with the
      letter “c”.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Origin and Purpose of IPA</h2>
    <p>
      The IPA was created by a group of language teachers and phoneticians in the late
      nineteenth century. Their aim was to design a system which:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>could be used for any language in the world,</li>
      <li>would not depend on traditional spelling systems, and</li>
      <li>would help learners to pronounce foreign languages more accurately.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since then, the IPA has been revised and expanded several times. Today it is recognised
      internationally and is widely used in dictionaries, language teaching materials,
      phonetics textbooks and research works.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Features of the IPA</h2>
    <p>
      Some important features of the International Phonetic Alphabet are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">1. One-to-one correspondence:</span><br>
        In the IPA, there is a strict one-to-one relationship between sound and symbol. This is
        very different from ordinary spelling. Once a student learns the IPA symbol for a
        particular sound, that symbol will always represent the same sound in any word.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">2. Universality:</span><br>
        The IPA is designed to represent the sounds of <em>all</em> languages, not only English.
        This makes it useful for describing and comparing different languages in a scientific
        way.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">3. Scientific basis:</span><br>
        The symbols and their arrangement are based on careful phonetic analysis of how sounds
        are produced by the organs of speech. Sounds are grouped according to place and manner
        of articulation, voicing, length, and other features.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">4. Use of special symbols and diacritics:</span><br>
        The IPA uses symbols borrowed mainly from the Roman and Greek alphabets, sometimes
        modified. In addition, it uses small marks called <em>diacritics</em> to show finer
        details of pronunciation, such as nasalisation, length or stress.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">5. Independence from spelling:</span><br>
        The IPA does not follow English spelling or the spelling of any other language. It is
        purely sound-based. This is why the IPA transcription of a word often looks different
        from its usual written form.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">IPA and English Pronunciation</h2>
    <p>
      For English, a specific subset of IPA symbols is used to represent:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>all the vowel sounds (both monophthongs and diphthongs), and</li>
      <li>all the consonant sounds found in a standard accent such as Received Pronunciation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When we write a word in IPA, we usually place the symbols between slant lines. This is
      called <span class="highlight">phonemic transcription</span>. It shows the important
      sounds of the word without going into very fine detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example (without giving the full set of symbols here), the IPA form of a word tells
      us:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>which vowel sound is used,</li>
      <li>which consonants occur at the beginning and end, and</li>
      <li>where the main stress falls in the word.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Thus IPA transcription acts like a pronunciation “code” which can be read by learners all
      over the world in the same way.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Advantages of IPA for Learners</h2>
    <p>
      The International Phonetic Alphabet is especially helpful for students of the Ability
      Enhancement Course in several ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">1. Accurate pronunciation from the dictionary:</span><br>
        Most good English dictionaries print the IPA form of each word immediately after the
        spelling. If a learner knows the symbols, he or she can find out the correct
        pronunciation of any new word without asking the teacher.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">2. Clear distinction between similar words:</span><br>
        Words which look similar in spelling but differ in pronunciation can be clearly
        distinguished with the help of IPA. For example, the difference between pairs like
        “ship/sheep”, “full/fool”, or “live/leave” becomes obvious when written in IPA.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">3. Overcoming mother-tongue influence:</span><br>
        Many Indian learners pronounce English words according to the spelling or according to
        sound patterns of their regional language. IPA teaches them to pay attention to the
        <em>actual</em> sounds of English and to produce them more accurately.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">4. Systematic learning of sounds:</span><br>
        IPA encourages students to learn the sound system of English in a systematic way,
        grouping sounds according to similarities and differences. This helps in mastering
        contrastive pairs and improving both listening and speaking skills.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">5. Useful for advanced study:</span><br>
        For those who later wish to study linguistics, translation or language teaching,
        familiarity with IPA is an essential foundation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">IPA in the Ability Enhancement Course</h2>
    <p>
      The Unimax textbook on “Language Skills – Listening and Speaking” introduces IPA in a
      simple and practical way. Students are not expected to memorise every symbol in the
      international chart. Instead, the focus is on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>recognising the main symbols used for English vowels and consonants,</li>
      <li>understanding how these symbols represent sounds studied earlier in phonetics,</li>
      <li>reading the IPA forms printed in the book and in dictionaries, and</li>
      <li>using IPA as a guide while practising pronunciation exercises.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In examination answers, students should show that they understand IPA as a practical tool,
      not as a difficult theory. It exists to make pronunciation clearer, not more complicated.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To sum up, the <span class="highlight">International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</span> is a
      scientifically designed set of symbols used to represent the sounds of human languages,
      including English, in a clear and consistent way. It offers a one-to-one relationship
      between sound and symbol and frees the learner from the irregularities of ordinary
      spelling. For students of the Ability Enhancement Course, a working knowledge of IPA is a
      powerful aid to correct pronunciation, better listening and independent use of
      dictionaries. In this sense, IPA is not merely an academic topic; it is a practical key
      that opens the door to confident and accurate spoken English.
