    </div>

    <!-- ANSWER STARTS -->

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Human beings are social and thinking creatures. They constantly need to express their
      experiences, thoughts, feelings, desires and reactions to the world around them.
      The most important tool which makes this expression possible is
      <span class="highlight">language</span>. Wherever human society exists, language exists;
      in fact, language and society grow together. For a student of communication skills, it is
      therefore essential to understand clearly what language is, how it works and why it is so
      central to human life.
    </p>

    <h2>Meaning of Language</h2>
    <p>
      In simple terms, <span class="highlight">language may be defined as a systematic
      set of sounds and symbols used by human beings to communicate meaning.</span>
      When we speak, we produce meaningful sounds; when we write, we use letters or other
      symbols which represent those sounds. All these sounds and symbols are arranged
      according to certain accepted rules so that others can understand what we wish to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, language is not just a random collection of words. It is an
      <span class="highlight">organized, rule-governed and meaningful system</span> which
      helps members of a speech community to interact with one another. It links the speaker
      with the listener and the writer with the reader.
    </p>

    <h2>Scholarly Views on Language</h2>
    <p>
      Different linguists and scholars have tried to define language in their own way.
      Though the wording is different, the central idea is the same:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Language is a <span class="highlight">means of communication</span> which enables
        people to share ideas and experiences.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is a <span class="highlight">system of vocal symbols</span>, that is, a set of
        speech sounds used in a structured way.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is a <span class="highlight">social institution</span>, because the rules of a
        language are accepted and followed by a particular community.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      From these views we can say that language is at once a
      <span class="highlight">system</span>, a <span class="highlight">symbolic code</span>
      and a <span class="highlight">social habit</span>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Essential Characteristics of Language</h2>
    <p>
      Though languages of the world differ in sound, script and vocabulary, every natural
      human language shows some common characteristics. These features help us to understand
      the real nature of language.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">1. Language is human and social:</span>
        It is a gift possessed only by human beings. Animals may produce sounds,
        but their cries do not form a complex, rule-governed system like human language.
        Moreover, language can exist only in society; it develops through interaction among
        people.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">2. Language is a system of symbols:</span>
        Words are symbols which stand for objects, actions and ideas. The word “book” is not the
        object itself; it is a symbol agreed upon by the speakers of English to represent that
        object. Because of this symbolic nature, language can talk not only about concrete things
        but also about abstract ideas such as freedom, honesty, love or justice.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">3. Language is structured and rule-governed:</span>
        Each language has its own grammar and phonetic rules. The sounds are combined to form
        words, words are combined to form phrases and sentences, and sentences are combined to
        form paragraphs. If we break these rules, communication becomes difficult or impossible.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">4. Language is primarily speech:</span>
        Historically, speech came first and writing developed later. A child learns to speak long
        before he or she learns to write. Written language is therefore a representation of
        spoken language, not the other way round.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">5. Language is arbitrary:</span>
        There is no natural connection between a word and its meaning. There is nothing in the
        object itself which demands that it should be called “tree” in English, “ped” in Hindi
        or “arbre” in French. Each community chooses its own set of sounds and attaches meaning
        to them.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">6. Language is creative and productive:</span>
        By using a limited number of sounds and words, human beings can produce an almost
        unlimited number of sentences. We constantly use language to create new expressions,
        slogans, poems, jokes and advertisements. This creativity is one of the greatest
        strengths of language.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">7. Language is flexible and dynamic:</span>
        Language is not fixed; it keeps changing with time. New words enter the language while
        old words fall out of use. Scientific discoveries, social changes and technological
        developments introduce fresh vocabulary, such as “online class”, “podcast”, or
        “download”.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">8. Language is culturally transmitted:</span>
        Children are not born with any language. They learn the language of the community in
        which they grow up. Through language they also absorb the values, beliefs and customs
        of their culture.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Functions of Language</h2>
    <p>
      Language performs a variety of functions in human life. A student should have a clear idea
      of these functions in order to appreciate the importance of language.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">1. Communicative function:</span>
        The most obvious function of language is to communicate information. We use language to
        ask questions, give answers, report events, share news and give instructions.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">2. Expressive function:</span>
        Language allows us to express our inner feelings and emotions. Joy, anger, fear, surprise
        and sorrow can all be expressed through appropriate words and tone of voice.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">3. Social function:</span>
        Language helps us build and maintain relationships. Greetings, polite expressions,
        compliments, apologies and small talk all create a friendly atmosphere in society and in
        the workplace.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">4. Intellectual function:</span>
        Language is the vehicle of thought. We think largely in words. Our ability to analyse,
        compare, argue or reason is closely connected with our command of language.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">5. Educational function:</span>
        All formal education depends on language. Textbooks, classroom teaching, examinations
        and academic discussions use language as their medium. A good mastery of language is
        therefore essential for success in studies.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">6. Cultural function:</span>
        Literature, religious texts, folk tales, songs and proverbs preserve the culture of a
        community. Through language, this cultural heritage is passed on from one generation to
        the next.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">7. Professional function:</span>
        In modern offices, business houses and institutions, effective communication skills are
        a major requirement. A person who can speak and write clearly in an appropriate language
        gains a distinct advantage in interviews, presentations and group discussions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Spoken and Written Language</h2>
    <p>
      For practical purposes, especially in the Ability Enhancement Course, we mainly deal with
      <span class="highlight">spoken English</span>. However, spoken and written forms of a
      language are closely related.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Spoken language is immediate, supported by voice, facial expression and body language.
        It is often less formal and more interactive.
      </li>
      <li>
        Written language is more permanent and is carefully planned and edited. It is useful
        when communication has to reach many people at different places and times.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A competent user of English should be able to handle both forms, selecting the style and
      level of formality suitable to a particular situation.
    </p>

    <h2>Importance of Language in Everyday Life</h2>
    <p>
      In our daily life we depend on language at every step. From the moment we wake up and greet
      our family members till the time we end the day, we continuously use language – face to face,
      on the phone, through messages or on social media. At college we use language to understand
      lectures, to ask doubts, to participate in discussions and to write examinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the professional world, language plays an equally central role. Interviews, meetings,
      reports, emails, video conferences and presentations demand clear and confident use of
      language. A person who can express ideas accurately and politely is more likely to succeed
      in his or her career. Thus, language is not merely a school subject; it is a life skill.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To sum up, language is a uniquely human, socially shared and systematically organized means
      of communication. It is made up of sounds and symbols which are arranged according to rules
      and used to convey meaning. Language reflects the culture of a community and at the same
      time helps in shaping the personality of each individual member of that community. Its
      functions are many – communicative, expressive, social, intellectual, educational and
      professional.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a student of the Ability Enhancement Course, understanding the nature of language is
      the first step towards improving listening and speaking skills. The richer and more accurate
      our language becomes, the more confidently we will be able to face academic, social and
      professional situations.

        The following answer forms part of a curated set of frequently recurring
        university questions. These questions have appeared repeatedly in past
        examinations and therefore hold a strong likelihood of reappearing in
        future assessments. However, while academically reliable and based on
        established patterns, they should be treated as high-quality preparation
        material rather than an absolute guarantee of examination recurrence.
