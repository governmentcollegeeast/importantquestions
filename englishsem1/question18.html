    <!-- ANSWER STARTS -->

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      When we think of communication, we usually think of <em>words</em> – what is said in a
      conversation, speech or interview. In reality, a very large part of the message is carried
      not by words but by <span class="highlight">non-verbal behaviour</span> – our facial
      expressions, posture, gestures, tone of voice and even silence. Two people may say exactly
      the same sentence, but the meaning we receive will be different because their non-verbal
      signals are different. For a student of the Ability Enhancement Course, understanding
      non-verbal communication is therefore essential, especially in listening and speaking
      activities such as discussions, interviews, presentations and group discussions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Meaning of Non-verbal Communication</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Non-verbal communication</span> may be defined as:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>“The process of sending and receiving messages without the use of words, through
      body movements, facial expressions, eye contact, gestures, posture, tone of voice,
      appearance, use of space and other silent signals.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, it includes all those ways in which we communicate <em>without actually
      speaking or writing</em>, or in which we add meaning to our words through visible and
      audible cues. Non-verbal communication can support, strengthen, modify – or even contradict
      – the verbal message.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Relationship between Verbal and Non-verbal Communication</h2>
    <p>
      Verbal and non-verbal communication are not separate; they operate together:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Non-verbal cues can <span class="highlight">reinforce</span> verbal messages
        (smiling while giving a compliment).</li>
      <li>They can <span class="highlight">substitute</span> words (nodding instead of saying
        “yes”).</li>
      <li>They can <span class="highlight">contradict</span> the spoken message (saying “I am
        fine” with a sad face).</li>
      <li>They help to <span class="highlight">regulate</span> the flow of conversation (eye
        contact, hand movements inviting another person to speak).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This close relationship is why non-verbal communication is often described as the “silent
      language” of interaction.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Main Types of Non-verbal Communication</h2>
    <p>
      Non-verbal behaviour appears in many forms. For practical purposes, we can discuss the
      following main types.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Facial Expressions</h3>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight">face</span> is perhaps the most expressive part of the body.
      It can show happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, anger, interest, boredom and many other
      emotions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A smile usually indicates friendliness, approval or pleasure.</li>
      <li>Raised eyebrows can show surprise or doubt.</li>
      <li>A frown may suggest worry or disagreement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In speaking situations, a pleasant and relaxed facial expression makes the listener feel
      comfortable, while a tense or expressionless face creates distance.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Eye Contact (Oculesics)</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Eye contact</span> refers to looking at another person’s eyes while
      speaking or listening. It is a powerful non-verbal signal.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reasonable eye contact shows attention, confidence and honesty.</li>
      <li>Constantly avoiding eye contact may be interpreted as shyness, insecurity or lack of
        interest.</li>
      <li>Staring fixedly can make the other person uncomfortable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In interviews, group discussions and presentations, balanced eye contact with different
      members of the audience is a sign of good communication.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Gestures</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Gestures</span> are movements of the hands, arms or head that carry
      meaning.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nodding usually means agreement or encouragement to continue.</li>
      <li>Raising a hand can indicate a desire to speak.</li>
      <li>Open-handed gestures often suggest openness and honesty.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Moderate and natural gestures add emphasis and variety to speech. However, too many or
      exaggerated gestures can distract the listener and appear artificial.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Posture and Body Orientation</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Posture</span> refers to the way we sit or stand. 
      <span class="highlight">Body orientation</span> indicates the direction in which we turn
      our body.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sitting or standing straight (without stiffness) shows alertness and confidence.</li>
      <li>Leaning slightly forward can indicate interest and involvement.</li>
      <li>Slouching or sliding down in a chair may be interpreted as laziness or lack of
        interest.</li>
      <li>Turning the body away from the other person can signal discomfort or rejection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In formal situations, a balanced and steady posture contributes to a positive impression.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Tone of Voice (Paralanguage)</h3>
    <p>
      Even when we use words, the way we say them – our <span class="highlight">tone of voice</span>
      – is a form of non-verbal communication, often called <span class="highlight">paralanguage</span>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Volume (loudness or softness),</li>
      <li>pitch (high or low voice),</li>
      <li>speed (fast or slow), and</li>
      <li>pauses and emphasis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      all convey meaning. For example, saying “Really?” in a rising tone can show surprise,
      while a flat tone may show doubt or lack of interest. A warm tone attracts listeners;
      a harsh tone pushes them away.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Proxemics (Use of Personal Space)</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Proxemics</span> is the study of how people use space in
      communication.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Standing too close may be felt as invasion of privacy.</li>
      <li>Standing too far may suggest coldness or dislike.</li>
      <li>In different cultures, acceptable distance varies; in formal situations, slightly
        greater distance is usual than in casual friendships.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The way we arrange chairs in a meeting or classroom also sends non-verbal messages about
      equality, authority and inclusion.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Appearance and Dress</h3>
    <p>
      Our <span class="highlight">appearance</span> – clothing, grooming, neatness and even
      small details like polished shoes or tidy hair – communicates silently.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Neat, appropriate dress shows respect for the occasion and for others.</li>
      <li>Very casual or careless dress in a formal interview can suggest lack of seriousness.</li>
      <li>Excessive jewellery or bright colours may distract from the message.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While appearance is not more important than ability, it influences first impressions.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Silence and Pauses</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Silence</span> may also be a non-verbal message.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Silence can show agreement, disagreement, shock, respect or reflection, depending on
        the context.</li>
      <li>Short pauses in speech help the listener to absorb important points.</li>
      <li>Embarrassed or very long silence, however, may suggest lack of preparation or
        confusion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Importance of Non-verbal Communication in Oral Interaction</h2>
    <p>
      Non-verbal communication plays several crucial roles, particularly in listening and
      speaking tasks included in the Ability Enhancement Course.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Adds Clarity and Emphasis to the Message</h3>
    <p>
      Non-verbal signals help to <span class="highlight">highlight</span> important parts of
      the message.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A change in tone or a hand gesture can underline a key point in a presentation.</li>
      <li>A nod from the listener shows that the message has been understood.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Without these cues, speech may sound flat, and the listener may miss what is really
      important.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Expresses Feelings and Attitudes</h3>
    <p>
      Words can describe emotions, but non-verbal behaviour actually <span class="highlight">
      shows</span> them.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sympathy, interest, enthusiasm, boredom, irritation or respect are often conveyed
        more clearly by facial expression and tone of voice than by words.</li>
      <li>In counselling, interviews and discussions, the listener’s non-verbal response
        tells the speaker whether it is safe to share more.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Builds or Damages Interpersonal Relationships</h3>
    <p>
      Warm, positive non-verbal behaviour – a friendly smile, open posture, relaxed tone –
      helps to build <span class="highlight">trust and rapport</span>. On the other hand:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Crossed arms, avoiding eye contact or looking at one’s phone may be read as rejection
        or lack of respect.</li>
      <li>Inappropriate touch or invasion of personal space can make others uncomfortable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Thus, social and professional relationships depend heavily on non-verbal communication.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Aids Listening and Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      For effective listening, we rely on non-verbal clues to understand the speaker’s meaning.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A puzzled expression may indicate that the listener has not understood and needs
        further explanation.</li>
      <li>A thoughtful look or nod shows that the listener is processing the information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this way, non-verbal signals serve as essential <span class="highlight">feedback</span>
      and help the speaker to adjust the message.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Supports Communication across Language Barriers</h3>
    <p>
      When people do not share the same language perfectly, non-verbal communication becomes
      a helpful support.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pointing, demonstrating and acting can make the message clearer even if vocabulary
        is limited.</li>
      <li>Smiles and gestures of politeness reduce nervousness and create a cooperative
        atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Important in Professional Contexts</h3>
    <p>
      In interviews, group discussions, meetings, presentations and customer interactions,
      evaluators and colleagues observe non-verbal behaviour carefully.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A candidate who enters confidently, greets politely, sits properly and maintains
        eye contact sends a strong positive message without speaking a single word.</li>
      <li>Similarly, in customer service, a welcoming posture and friendly expression are as
        important as the information given.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Developing Positive Non-verbal Communication</h2>
    <p>
      Since non-verbal behaviour can be improved through awareness and practice, students
      should consciously work on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>maintaining neat, appropriate appearance in formal situations,</li>
      <li>practising good posture and natural gestures while speaking,</li>
      <li>using suitable eye contact – neither avoiding nor staring,</li>
      <li>modulating voice for variety, clarity and warmth, and</li>
      <li>observing and learning from effective speakers and teachers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At the same time, one must remember that non-verbal meanings can be influenced by
      culture. What is polite in one culture may be considered rude in another, so sensitivity
      and flexibility are required.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To conclude, <span class="highlight">non-verbal communication</span> is the silent but
      powerful language of facial expressions, eye contact, gestures, posture, tone of voice,
      use of space, appearance and even deliberate silence. It always operates alongside
      verbal communication, reinforcing, modifying or sometimes contradicting spoken words.
      Its main types include facial expressions, eye behaviour, gestures, posture, paralanguage,
      proxemics, appearance and silence. Non-verbal cues are important because they add clarity
      and emphasis, express emotions and attitudes, build or damage relationships, provide
      feedback in listening and support communication across language barriers. For students
      of the Ability Enhancement Course, awareness and practice of positive non-verbal
      behaviour are as essential as good vocabulary and grammar, because it is often the
      non-verbal message that finally convinces, comforts or offends the listener in real-life
      communication.
