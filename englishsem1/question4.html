    <!-- ANSWER STARTS -->

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      English today is a world language and is spoken in many different countries with many
      different accents. The pronunciation of English in India, America, Australia or Scotland
      is not exactly the same. In such a situation, teachers and learners need one standard
      model of pronunciation which can be used for teaching, learning and reference. For this
      purpose, linguists have traditionally used a particular British accent known as
      <span class="highlight">RP variety of English</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      RP plays an important role in courses on listening and speaking skills because most
      dictionaries, teaching materials and pronunciation descriptions are still based on this
      model. A student who understands what RP is and what its main features are can use it as
      a reliable guide for improving his or her own speech.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Meaning of RP</h2>
    <p>
      The term <span class="highlight">RP</span> stands for
      <span class="highlight">Received Pronunciation</span>. The word “received” does not mean
      “heard”; it means “accepted” or “approved by educated society”. Therefore,
      <span class="highlight">Received Pronunciation may be defined as the socially accepted
      standard accent of educated speakers of British English</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      RP is not a separate language; the vocabulary and grammar are the same as in other
      varieties of English. What makes RP special is its <em>pronunciation</em> – that is, the
      way consonants, vowels, stress and intonation are used. It is a kind of reference accent
      which represents a neutral, region-free model of British English.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Historical Background of RP</h2>
    <p>
      RP developed gradually in England over several centuries. Historically:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It grew out of the speech of educated people in and around London, the political and
        cultural centre of England.
      </li>
      <li>
        During the 19th and early 20th centuries, it became associated with public schools,
        universities like Oxford and Cambridge, the civil service and the upper social classes.
      </li>
      <li>
        With the spread of radio and later television, the BBC (British Broadcasting
        Corporation) adopted this accent for most of its announcers and newsreaders. Hence RP
        was often called <span class="highlight">BBC English</span>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because of this historical development, RP came to be regarded as the prestige accent of
      Britain, and people from different regions tried to approach it if they wished to sound
      educated and neutral.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Main Features of RP Pronunciation</h2>
    <p>
      RP has a well-described and relatively stable sound system. Some important features are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">1. Vowel System:</span>
        RP has a clearly defined set of vowel sounds, including long and short vowels and a
        number of diphthongs. For example, the contrast between the vowels in “ship” and
        “sheep”, “full” and “fool”, or “cot” and “caught” is very carefully maintained.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">2. Non-rhotic Accent:</span>
        RP is <em>non-rhotic</em>, which means that the sound /r/ is normally not pronounced
        after a vowel unless it is followed by another vowel. Thus, in RP, the words “far”,
        “car” and “teacher” do not normally have a pronounced /r/ at the end, whereas “red”
        and “very” do.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">3. Clear Consonant Distinctions:</span>
        Pairs of consonants such as /p/–/b/, /t/–/d/, /k/–/g/, /f/–/v/ and /s/–/z/ are kept
        distinct. The “th” sounds in “think” and “this” are also carefully articulated, which
        are often difficult for Indian learners.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">4. Stress Patterns:</span>
        RP follows regular patterns of word stress and sentence stress. For instance, words like
        “photograph”, “development” and “responsible” have fixed stressed syllables. In
        sentences, content words (nouns, main verbs, adjectives, adverbs) receive more stress
        than function words (articles, prepositions, auxiliary verbs).
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">5. Intonation:</span>
        RP uses systematic rising and falling tones to express attitude, emphasis and
        grammatical meaning. Yes–no questions, wh-questions, statements, requests and
        exclamations have typical intonation patterns which make speech sound natural and
        polite.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">RP as a Teaching Model</h2>
    <p>
      In pronunciation teaching, RP is used as a <span class="highlight">reference model</span>
      rather than as a compulsory target. Many reliable dictionaries give the RP pronunciation
      of words using phonetic symbols. Textbooks on listening and speaking, including the
      prescribed Unimax book for the Ability Enhancement Course, base their explanation of
      sounds, stress and intonation on RP.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advantages of using RP as a model are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is <span class="highlight">well described</span>. Linguists have analysed it in
        detail, so students can get clear and consistent information about each sound.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is relatively <span class="highlight">free from strong regional colouring</span>.
        Unlike local dialects, it is understood across Britain and in many other parts of the
        world through media.
      </li>
      <li>
        It serves as a <span class="highlight">common standard</span> for international
        communication and for examinations, without favouring any particular region.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">RP and Indian English</h2>
    <p>
      Indian speakers of English generally use their own variety of
      <span class="highlight">Indian English</span>, influenced by local languages and
      educational backgrounds. It is neither necessary nor always possible for Indian students
      to imitate RP fully. However, RP is important for them in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It provides a <span class="highlight">benchmark</span> for correct and acceptable
        pronunciation of sounds and words.
      </li>
      <li>
        It helps learners to <span class="highlight">reduce strong mother-tongue influence</span>
        and to avoid errors that may lead to misunderstanding.
      </li>
      <li>
        It encourages a <span class="highlight">neutral and intelligible accent</span> which
        can be understood by listeners from different parts of India and abroad.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Thus, Indian learners are advised to move towards a clear and educated variety of Indian
      English which is <em>informed by</em> the principles of RP, without copying it
      mechanically.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Changing Status of RP</h2>
    <p>
      In earlier times, RP was strongly associated with the upper classes and with formal
      institutions. Today, its social image is slowly changing:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Many regional accents of English within Britain have gained respect and acceptance.
      </li>
      <li>
        The BBC now employs newsreaders with a range of accents, not only traditional RP.
      </li>
      <li>
        Linguists prefer to treat RP as one standard accent among many rather than the only
        correct model.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In spite of these changes, RP continues to be a useful pedagogical model because of its
      clarity, detailed description and long tradition in pronunciation teaching.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To sum up, the <span class="highlight">RP variety of English</span> is the historically
      prestigious and socially accepted standard accent of educated British English. It
      developed from the speech of educated London and southern England, became the accent of
      public schools and the BBC, and is now widely used as a reference model in pronunciation
      teaching, dictionary entries and language laboratories. RP is characterized by a
      distinctive system of vowels and consonants, non-rhotic pronunciation of /r/, regular
      patterns of stress and a well-defined intonation system.
    </p>
    <p>
      For students of the Ability Enhancement Course, knowledge of RP does not mean abandoning
      their own Indian identity. Rather, it means using a clear and neutral standard to improve
      intelligibility and confidence in spoken English. When used in this balanced way, RP
      becomes a practical tool for better listening and speaking, not a rigid accent to be
      copied blindly.
