      Q3. Write brief note on <strong>consonant sounds</strong> and <strong>vowel sounds</strong> in English.
    </div>

    <!-- ANSWER STARTS -->

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Spoken English is built from a limited number of basic sounds which combine in different
      ways to form words. These basic speech sounds are broadly grouped into
      <span class="highlight">vowels</span> and <span class="highlight">consonants</span>.
      A clear understanding of these two classes of sounds is essential for correct
      pronunciation, accurate listening and effective communication. In the standard variety
      of English generally taught to Indian learners (Received Pronunciation based model),
      there are <span class="highlight">20 vowel sounds</span> and <span class="highlight">24 consonant sounds</span>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Vowel Sounds in English</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Vowels</span> are speech sounds produced with a
      <span class="highlight">free passage of air</span> through the mouth. The air coming
      from the lungs is not blocked by the tongue, lips or teeth; it flows out smoothly and
      the sound is shaped mainly by the position of the tongue and the opening of the mouth.
      Because the air stream is not obstructed, vowel sounds are relatively loud and can be
      sustained for a longer time. Every English word must contain at least one vowel sound.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub">1. Types of Vowel Sounds</h3>
    <p>
      For practical purposes, the vowels of English may be divided into two main groups:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">a) Pure Vowels (Monophthongs)</span><br>
        These are <em>single</em>, steady sounds in which the tongue remains in one position
        throughout the pronunciation of the vowel. Examples (without using phonetic symbols)
        can be seen in words such as “sit”, “seat”, “cat”, “caught”, “put”, “food”, “ago”
        etc. Each of these has one clear, stable vowel quality from beginning to end.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">b) Diphthongs</span><br>
        A diphthong is a <em>gliding vowel</em>. It begins as one vowel sound and glides towards
        another within the same syllable. English has several diphthongs, heard in words like
        “time”, “boy”, “now”, “day”, “go”, “here” and “there”. In such sounds, the tongue moves
        during pronunciation, but the glide is smooth and continuous, so the listener hears only
        one complex vowel.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="sub">2. Position of the Tongue and Lips</h3>
    <p>
      The quality of a vowel depends mainly on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Height of the tongue</span> – whether it is high, mid or low in the mouth.
        This gives us close, half-close, half-open and open vowels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Part of the tongue raised</span> – front, central or back. For example, the
        vowel in “see” is a front vowel, while the vowel in “too” is a back vowel.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Shape of the lips</span> – rounded, spread or neutral. The vowels in “too” and
        “caught” are produced with rounded lips, whereas the vowel in “see” is produced with
        spread lips.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In the classroom, learners are not expected to memorise a full vowel chart, but they
      should understand that the differences in these three factors create different vowel
      sounds. This awareness helps them to adjust the tongue and lips to produce more accurate
      English vowels.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub">3. Importance of Vowel Sounds</h3>
    <p>
      Vowel sounds are crucial for intelligibility. Even a small change in vowel quality can
      change the meaning of a word. Pairs such as “ship/sheep”, “full/fool” and “hat/heart”
      differ only in their vowel sounds. For this reason, the Ability Enhancement Course
      lays emphasis on careful listening to vowel contrasts and on regular practice in
      pronouncing them.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Consonant Sounds in English</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Consonants</span> are speech sounds produced when the outgoing
      air stream is <span class="highlight">partly or completely blocked</span> at some point
      in the mouth. During the production of a consonant, the tongue, lips or other speech
      organs touch or approach each other, creating a narrowing or closure. When this closure
      is released, different types of consonant sounds are heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      In English, there are <span class="highlight">24 consonant sounds</span> which include
      plosives (or stops), fricatives, affricates, nasals, laterals and approximants. Many of
      them are written with the familiar letters of the alphabet, but some sounds, such as the
      “th” sounds in “think” and “this”, are not present in most Indian languages and therefore
      need special attention.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub">1. Voiced and Voiceless Consonants</h3>
    <p>
      A basic distinction among consonants is between <span class="highlight">voiced</span>
      and <span class="highlight">voiceless</span> sounds.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Voiced consonants</span> are produced when the vocal cords in the
        larynx vibrate. Examples include the sounds represented by the letters b, d, g, v, z,
        m, n, l and r. If a student places a hand lightly on the throat while pronouncing “zoo”
        or “ball”, a gentle vibration can be felt.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Voiceless consonants</span> are produced without such vibration.
        The vocal cords are apart and the air passes through freely. Examples are p, t, k, f, s
        and the “sh” sound in “she”. Here, the hand on the throat will not feel vibration.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Many consonants occur in voiced–voiceless pairs: /p/ and /b/, /t/ and /d/, /k/ and /g/,
/f/ and /v/, /s/ and /z/. Confusing these pairs may lead to misunderstanding, so careful practice
in hearing and saying them is important.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub">2. Place and Manner of Articulation</h3>
    <p>
      Another way of describing consonants is through:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Place of articulation</span> – where the air is obstructed. For example,
        <em>bilabial</em> consonants like /p/ and /b/ are made with both lips; <em>dental</em>
        consonants like “th” in “think” are made with the tongue against the teeth; and
        <em>velar</em> consonants like /k/ and /g/ involve the back of the tongue against the
        soft palate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Manner of articulation</span> – how the air is obstructed. A complete closure
        followed by a sudden release gives a <em>plosive</em> (p, t, k, b, d, g); a narrow
        passage that allows air to escape with friction gives a <em>fricative</em> (f, v, s, z,
        “sh”); a combination of stop plus fricative gives an <em>affricate</em> (as in “ch” and
        “j”); a lowering of the soft palate so that air passes through the nose gives <em>nasals</em>
        (m, n, “ng”); while /l/ and /r/ are examples of <em>approximants</em> or smooth,
        glide-like consonants.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Though students are not required to produce all these technical labels in examination, a
      general idea of “where” and “how” the sound is made helps to correct faulty articulation.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub">3. Role of Consonant Sounds in English Words</h3>
    <p>
      Consonants usually occur at the beginning and end of syllables and words, providing a
      kind of framework around which vowel sounds are arranged. Words such as “plate”, “strong”
      or “next” begin or end with clusters of two or three consonants. Many Indian languages do
      not allow such clusters, so learners must practise moving smoothly from one consonant to
      another without inserting extra vowels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consonant contrasts are often responsible for differences in meaning: “pin”/“bin”,
      “cap”/“cab”, “fan”/“van” and “sip”/“zip”. Accurate recognition and production of such
      contrasts is therefore necessary for clear communication.
    </p>

    <h2>Relationship between Vowel and Consonant Sounds</h2>
    <p>
      Vowels and consonants do not function in isolation. They come together to form
      <span class="highlight">syllables</span>, which are the real building blocks of words.
      A syllable normally has a vowel at its centre, possibly surrounded by one or more
      consonants. For example, the word “language” has two syllables: “lang-” and “-guage”; the
      word “student” also has two syllables; the word “ability” has four.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good pronunciation depends on maintaining the right balance between vowels and consonants,
      giving each sound its due length and clarity. If vowels are too weak or consonants are
      dropped, speech becomes unclear and accented; if consonants are too strong, speech may
      sound jerky and unnatural.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In conclusion, English pronunciation rests on a system of <span class="highlight">vowel
      and consonant sounds</span>. Vowels are voiced sounds produced without obstruction of the
      air stream; they provide the musical quality of speech and form the heart of every
      syllable. Consonants are produced with partial or complete obstruction of the air stream;
      they give shape and definition to words. A working knowledge of the main vowel types
      (pure vowels and diphthongs) and consonant features (voiced/voiceless, place and manner
      of articulation) enables learners to listen more sharply and speak more clearly.
      For students of the Ability Enhancement Course, regular practice with these sounds is an
      indispensable step towards fluent and intelligible English.
