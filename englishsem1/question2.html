      Q2. Write a short note on <strong>Phonetics</strong>.
    </div>

    <!-- ANSWER -->

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Whenever we speak, we produce a continuous stream of sounds. These sounds do not arise
      accidentally; they are produced in a controlled manner by different organs of speech such
      as the tongue, lips, teeth, palate and vocal cords. For effective communication, it is not
      enough to know words and rules of grammar. We must also know how to pronounce these words
      correctly and clearly. The scientific study which helps us to understand and describe
      speech sounds in a systematic way is called <span class="highlight">phonetics</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Ability Enhancement Course, phonetics occupies an important position because it
      lays the foundation for accurate listening and speaking skills in English. A student who
      understands the basic principles of phonetics can easily improve pronunciation, stress and
      intonation, and can reduce mother-tongue influence.
    </p>

    <h2>Meaning of Phonetics</h2>
    <p>
      The word <span class="highlight">phonetics</span> comes from the Greek word
      <em>phon&eacute;</em> meaning “sound” or “voice”. In simple terms, phonetics may be
      defined as the <span class="highlight">scientific study of speech sounds</span> and the
      manner in which they are produced, transmitted and received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phonetics does not study the meaning of words; it focuses only on the physical side of 
      spoken language – how sounds are articulated by the speaker and how they are heard by the
      listener. It tells us:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>which speech organs are used for a particular sound,</li>
      <li>how the air stream is controlled during speech, and</li>
      <li>what kind of sound (vowel or consonant) is finally produced.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Therefore, phonetics is a practical tool which helps learners to hear and produce English
      sounds in a more accurate and confident manner.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Main Branches of Phonetics</h2>
    <p>
      For convenience, phonetics is usually divided into three main branches. All the three
      branches are closely related and together they give us a complete picture of speech
      sounds.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">1. Articulatory Phonetics</span><br>
        This branch studies how speech sounds are <em>produced</em> by the various organs of
        speech. It describes the position and movement of the lips, tongue, teeth, soft palate,
        vocal cords and so on. For example, it explains that the English sound /p/ is produced by
        closing both lips and then releasing the air with a slight explosion, while the sound /s/
        is produced by allowing the air to pass between the tongue and the teeth without any
        vibration of the vocal cords.
        <br><br>
        For learners of English, articulatory phonetics is very useful because it gives clear
        guidelines for the correct placement of the speech organs while pronouncing difficult
        sounds.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">2. Acoustic Phonetics</span><br>
        Acoustic phonetics studies what happens to speech sounds after they have left the mouth
        of the speaker. It examines the <em>physical properties</em> of these sounds in the air,
        such as frequency, intensity, duration and quality. With the help of instruments, sound
        waves can be recorded and visually represented in the form of wave-forms or spectrograms.
        <br><br>
        Although this branch is more technical and is mainly used by researchers, it shows that
        speech sounds are also a kind of energy travelling through the air.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">3. Auditory Phonetics</span><br>
        This branch deals with the way speech sounds are <em>heard and perceived</em> by the
        listener. It is concerned with the human ear and the brain, and studies how different
        sounds are distinguished and recognized. For example, it explains how a listener can
        hear the difference between /iː/ and /ɪ/ in words like “sheep” and “ship”.
        <br><br>
        Auditory phonetics is important in understanding problems of listening comprehension and
        in treating certain speech and hearing disorders.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scope of Phonetics in English</h2>
    <p>
      When we apply phonetics to English, we examine the entire sound system of the language.
      This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the <span class="highlight">vowel sounds</span> and their length and quality,</li>
      <li>the <span class="highlight">consonant sounds</span> and the manner and place of their articulation,</li>
      <li>the <span class="highlight">syllable structure</span> of English words,</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">word stress</span> and the pattern of strong and weak syllables,</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">intonation</span>, that is, the rise and fall of voice in sentences, and</li>
      <li>the <span class="highlight">phonetic transcription</span> of words and sentences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A student becomes aware that English spelling is often misleading. The same letter may
      represent different sounds and the same sound can be written using different letters.
      Phonetics therefore provides a more reliable, sound-based system for representing speech.
    </p>

    <h2>International Phonetic Alphabet and Phonetic Transcription</h2>
    <p>
      To describe sounds accurately, linguists use a special set of symbols known as the
      <span class="highlight">International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</span>. In this system,
      each distinct sound or <em>phoneme</em> is given a separate symbol. For example, the word
      “caught” is written as /kɔːt/ and the word “cat” as /k&aelig;t/. Even if spelling varies,
      the phonetic transcription clearly shows how the word should be pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      For learners of English, the ability to read basic phonetic symbols is a practical skill.
      It helps them to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>use dictionaries more effectively,</li>
      <li>notice the correct pronunciation of new words,</li>
      <li>distinguish between similar-sounding words, and</li>
      <li>record the pronunciation of unfamiliar words during listening practice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of Phonetics for Indian Learners of English</h2>
    <p>
      In the Indian context, students usually learn English in an environment where their
      mother tongue exerts a strong influence on their pronunciation. As a result, some English
      sounds are replaced by similar sounds of the regional language, and stress and intonation
      patterns also get affected. Phonetics provides a scientific remedy for these problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study of phonetics benefits Indian learners in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Correct Pronunciation:</span>
        By understanding how each sound is produced, students can gradually correct habitual
        errors such as confusing /b/ and /v/, or /s/ and /ʃ/.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Improved Listening:</span>
        Practice in phonetic discrimination trains the ear to recognize subtle differences in
        sounds, stress and rhythm. This leads to better comprehension of spoken English in
        classrooms, interviews and audio-visual media.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Clarity and Intelligibility:</span>
        The goal of learning phonetics is not to imitate a foreign accent, but to speak English
        in a way that is clear and easily understood by listeners from different regions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Confidence in Speaking:</span>
        When students know why a particular sound is pronounced in a certain manner, they feel
        more secure and confident while speaking in public, participating in group discussions
        or giving presentations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Professional Advantage:</span>
        Correct pronunciation is highly valued in professions related to teaching, customer
        service, aviation, broadcasting and corporate communication. A basic knowledge of
        phonetics, therefore, adds to employability.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Phonetics and the Ability Enhancement Course</h2>
    <p>
      The prescribed book on “Language Skills – Listening and Speaking” includes phonetics as a
      foundation topic because all higher skills of communication rest upon it. Activities such
      as minimal pair practice, stress marking, reading passages aloud and listening to recorded
      material are designed to develop sensitivity to sounds. When students understand the
      principles of phonetics, these classroom activities become more meaningful and effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      In examination answers, it is important for students to show that they recognize phonetics
      not as a dry theory but as a practical aid to better English speech.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To conclude, <span class="highlight">phonetics is the scientific study of speech sounds</span>
      – their production by the speech organs, their physical nature as sound waves and their
      reception by the human ear. It is divided into articulatory, acoustic and auditory
      phonetics, each dealing with a different stage of the speech chain. For students of the
      Ability Enhancement Course, phonetics is extremely valuable because it improves both
      listening and speaking, corrects faulty pronunciation and builds confidence in oral
      communication. A clear understanding of phonetics, therefore, is an essential step towards
      mastering spoken English.
