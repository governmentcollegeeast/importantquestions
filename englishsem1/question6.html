    <!-- ANSWER STARTS -->

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      When we speak English, we do not pronounce each letter separately. Instead, we naturally
      break words into small rhythmic units, which we say in a single breath or beat. These
      units are called <span class="highlight">syllables</span>. The concept of the syllable
      is basic to the study of pronunciation because it is directly connected with word stress,
      rhythm and fluency. A learner who understands syllables will find it easier to pronounce
      long words, to divide words at the end of a line, and to follow the natural rhythm of
      spoken English.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Meaning of Syllable</h2>
    <p>
      In simple terms, a <span class="highlight">syllable</span> is the smallest unit of
      pronunciation that can be uttered in one effort of breath. It is a cluster of one or more
      sounds which is pronounced as a single beat. In the word “language”, for example, we can
      feel two beats: “lang–” and “–guage”. In “ability” we feel four beats: a–bi–li–ty. Each
      beat is a syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technically, a syllable is a group of sounds organised around a central
      <span class="highlight">vowel sound</span>. This central vowel is the “heart” or
      <em>nucleus</em> of the syllable, while the consonant sounds before and after it are like
      its “edges”.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Structure of a Syllable</h2>
    <p>
      The internal structure of a syllable can be understood through three main parts. This
      structure helps us to see how consonants and vowels fit together in a word.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">1. Onset</span><br>
        The <span class="highlight">onset</span> is the consonant or group of consonants that
        come <em>before</em> the vowel in a syllable. For example, in the word “cat”, the sound
        at the beginning “c–” forms the onset; in “strong”, the sounds “str–” form the onset.
        Some syllables do not have an onset; they begin directly with a vowel, as in “at” or
        “able”.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">2. Nucleus</span><br>
        The <span class="highlight">nucleus</span> is the central and most important part of the
        syllable. It is usually a vowel sound. In the words “cat”, “tea” and “about”, the vowel
        sounds are the nuclei. Without a nucleus, a syllable cannot exist. That is why every
        syllable must contain a vowel sound, though it may or may not have consonants around it.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">3. Coda</span><br>
        The <span class="highlight">coda</span> consists of the consonant or group of consonants
        that come <em>after</em> the vowel within the syllable. In “cat”, “t” is the coda; in
        “asks”, the cluster “sks” is the coda. Some syllables have no coda and end in a vowel,
        as in “go”, “see”, “free”.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The combination of nucleus and coda is sometimes called the <span class="highlight">
      rhyme</span> of the syllable. This is because words that rhyme in poetry share the same
      nucleus and coda but have different onsets, for example “cat”, “mat”, “hat”.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Types of Syllables</h2>
    <p>
      Syllables in English can be classified in different ways. Some important distinctions are:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Open and Closed Syllables</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Open syllable:</span> A syllable that ends in a vowel sound (no
        coda) is called an open syllable. Examples: “go”, “me”, “re–” in “report”. In such
        syllables, the vowel is often pronounced with greater length and clarity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Closed syllable:</span> A syllable that ends in a consonant
        sound (has a coda) is called a closed syllable. Examples: “cat”, “cup”, “doc–” in
        “doctor”. Here the vowel is usually shorter.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Monosyllabic and Polysyllabic Words</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Monosyllabic words</span> have only one syllable, e.g. “book”,
        “time”, “boy”, “speak”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Disyllabic words</span> have two syllables, e.g. “happy”,
        “teacher”, “city”, “language”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Polysyllabic words</span> have three or more syllables, e.g.
        “university”, “opportunity”, “communication”.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In examinations, students may be asked to count syllables or to divide words according to
      syllables, especially in questions related to stress and pronunciation.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Strong and Weak Syllables</h3>
    <p>
      In the rhythm of English, some syllables are pronounced more clearly than others.
      Therefore, we can distinguish between:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Strong syllables</span> – These syllables carry either the main
        stress or secondary stress in a word. They generally contain full, clear vowel sounds.
        For example, in the word “teacher”, the first syllable “tea–” is strong.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Weak syllables</span> – These syllables are unstressed and are
        pronounced more quickly and lightly. They often contain a reduced vowel sound, like the
        neutral sound in “about” or “ago”. In the word “teacher”, the second syllable “–cher” is
        relatively weak.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The pattern of strong and weak syllables gives English its characteristic rhythm and is a
      key area in listening and speaking practice.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Syllable Division (Syllabification)</h2>
    <p>
      The process of <span class="highlight">syllabification</span> means dividing a word into
      its syllables. While exact division sometimes depends on phonetic and morphological
      factors, a few simple guidelines are useful for learners:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Every syllable must have one vowel sound (either a monophthong or a diphthong). Count
        the vowel sounds, not the letters, to estimate the number of syllables.
      </li>
      <li>
        When there is one consonant between two vowels, it generally joins the vowel that
        follows: e.g. “pa–per”, “la–dy”.
      </li>
      <li>
        When there are two consonants between vowels, they are usually divided, unless they
        form a natural consonant cluster: e.g. “hap–py”, “dif–ferent”, but “stu–dent” where “st”
        is a cluster at the beginning.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the end of a line in writing, division should follow natural syllable breaks and not
        break a syllable artificially.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These rules help students in correct pronunciation and in neat written presentation when
      they need to break long words at the end of a line.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Importance of Syllable in Pronunciation</h2>
    <p>
      The concept of the syllable is not merely theoretical. It has several practical uses in
      learning English pronunciation:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">1. Word Stress:</span><br>
        Stress in English falls on particular syllables within a word. For example, in
        “student”, the first syllable is stressed; in “about”, the second; in “university”, the
        penultimate syllable is stressed. To understand and mark stress correctly, one must
        first be able to identify the syllables of a word.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">2. Rhythm and Fluency:</span><br>
        English is often described as a <em>stress-timed</em> language. This means that the time
        between stressed syllables tends to remain roughly equal, while weak syllables are
        squeezed in between. When learners become aware of syllable patterns, they can speak
        with a more natural rhythm, instead of giving equal weight to every syllable.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">3. Spelling and Pronunciation:</span><br>
        Many spelling patterns in English are easier to remember if we break the word into
        syllables. For example, “com–mu–ni–ca–tion” or “re–spon–si–bi–li–ty”. Similarly, the
        pronunciation of long words becomes manageable when spoken syllable by syllable.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">4. Listening Comprehension:</span><br>
        In fast speech, native or fluent speakers often reduce weak syllables and join words
        together. A learner who understands how syllables behave can still follow the message,
        even when some sounds are not fully pronounced.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">5. Accent Improvement:</span><br>
        Indian learners sometimes place stress on the wrong syllable or fail to reduce weak
        syllables. This makes speech sound “flat” or heavily influenced by the mother tongue.
        Conscious practice with syllable patterns helps in moving towards a clearer, more
        internationally intelligible accent.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Syllable and the Ability Enhancement Course</h2>
    <p>
      The prescribed Unimax book on “Language Skills – Listening and Speaking” includes the
      topic of syllables because it forms the base for later topics like word stress, sentence
      stress and intonation. Classroom activities such as clapping for each syllable, dividing
      words on the board and marking stressed syllables in new vocabulary items all make use of
      this concept. A solid understanding of syllables therefore supports the entire programme
      of developing oral communication skills.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To conclude, a <span class="highlight">syllable</span> is a basic unit of speech, usually
      centred around one vowel sound and pronounced as a single beat. It has an internal
      structure consisting of onset, nucleus and coda, and may be open or closed, strong or
      weak. Words may be monosyllabic or polysyllabic, but in every case their pronunciation,
      spelling and rhythm depend on the correct identification of syllables. For students of the
      Ability Enhancement Course, the study of syllables is a practical step towards better
      pronunciation, more confident speaking and more accurate listening. A clear grasp of this
      simple but powerful concept can greatly improve the overall quality of a learner’s spoken
      English.
