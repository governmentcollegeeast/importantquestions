    <!-- ANSWER STARTS -->

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      While learning English, a student must pay attention not only to individual sounds and
      words but also to the <span class="highlight">music of speech</span> and the internal
      construction of words. <span class="highlight">Intonation</span> deals with the rise and
      fall of the voice in speaking, whereas <span class="highlight">prefixes</span> and
      <span class="highlight">suffixes</span> are added to root words to create new meanings.
      Together, these three areas link pronunciation and vocabulary building, and play a central
      role in developing effective listening and speaking skills.
    </p>

    <!-- INTONATION SECTION -->

    <h2 class="sub">1. Intonation</h2>
    <p>
      The term <span class="highlight">intonation</span> refers to the
      <span class="highlight">rise and fall of the pitch of the voice while speaking</span>.
      In simple words, it is the “tune” or “melody” of a sentence. Even if the words remain the
      same, a change in intonation can express different meanings, attitudes or emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the sentence “You are coming” can be a statement, a question, a doubt or a
      surprise depending on how the voice rises or falls. Therefore, intonation is not a mere
      decoration; it is a functional part of spoken English.
    </p>

    <h3>1.1 Main Intonation Patterns</h3>
    <p>
      Although speech is continuous, for teaching purposes we usually talk about three basic
      intonation patterns:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Falling intonation:</span><br>
        Here the pitch of the voice goes down at the end of the sentence. It is common in:
        <ul>
          <li>simple statements – “He is coming.”</li>
          <li>wh-questions – “Where are you going?”</li>
          <li>commands – “Close the door.”</li>
          <li>exclamations – “What a beautiful view!”</li>
        </ul>
        Falling intonation usually shows completeness, certainty and firmness.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Rising intonation:</span><br>
        In this pattern, the pitch of the voice rises towards the end. It often occurs in:
        <ul>
          <li>yes–no questions – “Are you ready?”</li>
          <li>polite requests – “Could you help me?”</li>
          <li>unfinished lists – “We bought apples, oranges, and pears…”</li>
        </ul>
        Rising intonation often suggests incompleteness, doubt, expectation or politeness.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Fall–rise or rise–fall patterns:</span><br>
        In more advanced speech, the voice may fall and then rise, or rise and then fall,
        within the same sentence. These patterns are used to express contrast, hesitation,
        partial agreement, or special emotional colouring. For example, “I <em>like</em> it”
        with a fall–rise may suggest “I like it, but…”.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Functions of Intonation</h3>
    <p>
      Intonation performs several important functions in spoken English:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Grammatical function:</span>
        It helps to distinguish between statement and question, and between complete and
        incomplete utterances.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Attitudinal function:</span>
        Intonation expresses the speaker’s attitude – friendliness, surprise, anger, sarcasm,
        interest, boredom, etc. The same words can sound polite or rude depending on the tune.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Discourse function:</span>
        By using suitable intonation, the speaker can mark important information, show the end
        of a topic or indicate that more is coming.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Emphatic function:</span>
        A particular word can be highlighted by a special pitch movement, giving it extra
        importance in the sentence.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Importance of Intonation for Learners</h3>
    <p>
      For Indian learners, mastering intonation is essential because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Speaking with a flat tone makes English sound dull and unnatural, even if grammar and
        vocabulary are correct.
      </li>
      <li>
        Incorrect intonation can change the listener’s interpretation of the speaker’s attitude.
        A neutral statement may sound rude or uninterested if the tune is wrong.
      </li>
      <li>
        Good intonation improves listening comprehension, as learners become sensitive to the
        way information and attitude are signalled through pitch movement.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Therefore, the Ability Enhancement Course encourages students to listen to authentic
      speech and to practise reading aloud with correct intonation patterns.
    </p>

    <!-- PREFIXES SECTION -->

    <h2 class="sub">2. Prefixes</h2>
    <p>
      A <span class="highlight">prefix</span> is a group of letters added to the
      <span class="highlight">beginning</span> of a root word to form a new word with a changed
      meaning. The spelling of the root generally remains the same, but the meaning is extended,
      reversed or made negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>“happy” → “<span class="highlight">un</span>happy” (not happy)</li>
      <li>“possible” → “<span class="highlight">im</span>possible” (not possible)</li>
      <li>“paid” → “<span class="highlight">pre</span>paid” (paid in advance)</li>
      <li>“write” → “<span class="highlight">re</span>write” (write again)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.1 Common Functions of Prefixes</h3>
    <p>
      Prefixes usually perform the following functions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Negation:</span> Adding the idea of “not” or “without”, as in
        “unfair”, “impure”, “disloyal”, “illegal”, “non-stop”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Repetition:</span> Showing the idea of doing something again, as
        in “reopen”, “rewrite”, “reconsider”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Time and order:</span> Indicating “before”, “after” or “during”,
        as in “prepaid”, “post-war”, “midterm”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Direction or position:</span> As in “interstate”, “subway”,
        “transcontinental”.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Importance of Prefixes</h3>
    <p>
      Knowledge of common prefixes helps learners to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Guess meanings</span> of unfamiliar words. If a student knows
        that “anti–” means “against”, he or she can understand words like “anti-social”,
        “antibiotic”, “anti-corruption”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Build vocabulary systematically</span> by recognising groups of
        related words – “patient”, “impatient”, “patience”, “impatience”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Use words precisely</span> in speaking and writing, as small
        changes in prefixes often give a new shade of meaning.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- SUFFIXES SECTION -->

    <h2 class="sub">3. Suffixes</h2>
    <p>
      A <span class="highlight">suffix</span> is a group of letters added to the
      <span class="highlight">end</span> of a root word to form a new word. Suffixes often
      change not only the meaning but also the <span class="highlight">grammatical class</span>
      of the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>“teach” → “teach<span class="highlight">er</span>” (verb → noun)</li>
      <li>“kind” → “kind<span class="highlight">ness</span>” (adjective → noun)</li>
      <li>“hope” → “hope<span class="highlight">ful</span>” (noun → adjective)</li>
      <li>“quick” → “quick<span class="highlight">ly</span>” (adjective → adverb)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.1 Types of Suffixes</h3>
    <p>
      We may broadly distinguish two groups:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">a) Noun-forming suffixes</span><br>
        These turn verbs or adjectives into nouns. Common examples include:
        <ul>
          <li>“-er/-or” → “writer”, “actor”, “teacher”</li>
          <li>“-ness” → “kindness”, “darkness”, “happiness”</li>
          <li>“-tion/-sion” → “education”, “expansion”, “decision”</li>
          <li>“-ment” → “development”, “agreement”, “movement”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">b) Adjective and adverb-forming suffixes</span><br>
        These make describing words and adverbs of manner:
        <ul>
          <li>“-ful” → “helpful”, “hopeful”, “careful”</li>
          <li>“-less” → “careless”, “powerless”, “homeless”</li>
          <li>“-ous” → “dangerous”, “famous”, “courageous”</li>
          <li>“-ly” → “slowly”, “quietly”, “happily”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 Importance of Suffixes</h3>
    <p>
      Suffixes are extremely useful in learning English because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        They help learners to <span class="highlight">recognise word families</span>. From the
        base word “beauty”, one can get “beautiful” and “beautifully”; from “comfort”, we get
        “comfortable” and “comfortably”.
      </li>
      <li>
        They make it easier to <span class="highlight">use correct word forms</span> in
        sentences, e.g. choosing between “hope”, “hopeful” and “hopefully” depending on whether
        a noun, adjective or adverb is required.
      </li>
      <li>
        They contribute to <span class="highlight">academic vocabulary</span>, especially through
        suffixes like “-tion”, “-ment”, “-ity”, which are common in formal writing and
        examinations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- LINKING THE THREE CONCEPTS -->

    <h2>Link between Intonation, Prefixes and Suffixes</h2>
    <p>
      At first sight, intonation on the one hand and prefixes/suffixes on the other may appear
      unrelated. In fact, they are connected in the overall development of language skills:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Intonation</span> helps the learner to speak sentences with the
        correct tune, expressing meaning and attitude clearly in oral communication.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Prefixes and suffixes</span> help the learner to expand
        vocabulary and to understand the structure of words, which is essential for reading,
        writing and precise expression.
      </li>
      <li>
        Together, they ensure that a student not only knows “what to say” (through word
        formation) but also “how to say it” (through appropriate intonation).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To conclude, <span class="highlight">intonation</span> is the rise and fall of the voice
      in speech and is responsible for the natural melody, attitude and meaning of spoken
      English. <span class="highlight">Prefixes</span> are added at the beginnings of words and
      usually modify or reverse their meaning, while <span class="highlight">suffixes</span>
      are added at the ends of words and often change their grammatical class. All three are
      important topics in the Ability Enhancement Course because they build a bridge between
      sound and structure. A clear understanding of intonation patterns makes spoken English
      expressive and polite, and a sound knowledge of prefixes and suffixes makes vocabulary
      richer, more accurate and more flexible. Together they equip the learner to handle
      academic, social and professional communication with greater confidence.
