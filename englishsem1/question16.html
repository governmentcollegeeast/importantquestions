    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In the age of globalisation and digital technology, organisations, universities and
      individuals need to communicate with people who may be physically far away. Travelling for
      every meeting is expensive and time-consuming. As a result, modern communication makes
      frequent use of <span class="highlight">teleconferencing</span> and 
      <span class="highlight">video-conferencing</span>. Both are based on electronic transmission
      of voice and data, but they differ in the amount of information they carry and in the kind
      of contact they create between participants.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Meaning of Teleconferencing</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Teleconferencing</span> is a general term for any 
      <span class="highlight">live, interactive meeting in which people at different locations
      communicate with one another through telecommunication networks</span>. In its simplest
      form, teleconferencing uses only voice, as in a <em>conference call</em> where several people
      participate through telephone or internet-based audio links.
    </p>
    <p>
      In teleconferencing:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>participants can hear one another’s voices in real time,</li>
      <li>they may also share documents or presentations on a common platform, and</li>
      <li>only the <span class="highlight">audio</span> channel is essential; the visual image of
        participants is not necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Meaning of Video-conferencing</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Video-conferencing</span> is a <span class="highlight">specialised
      form of teleconferencing in which both sound and live video images are transmitted between
      participants at different locations</span>. Each person can hear the others and also see
      them on a screen. Modern platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams and similar
      tools are common examples of video-conferencing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, every video-conference is a teleconference, but every teleconference is not a
      video-conference. Video-conferencing requires more technology but creates a more “face-to-face”
      feeling among participants.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Features of Teleconferencing</h2>
    <p>
      Important features of teleconferencing include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Audio-based communication:</span>
        The basic channel is voice. Participants talk to each other as in a telephone
        conversation, but more than two persons can join at the same time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Multi-point connection:</span>
        Three or more locations can be connected in one teleconference, allowing a scattered
        team to participate in a single meeting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Real-time interaction:</span>
        Conversation takes place instantly; questions and answers can be exchanged without delay.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Possibility of data sharing:</span>
        In more advanced systems, participants may also share documents, presentations or charts
        through a shared screen or platform, although this is not essential.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Relatively lower technical requirements:</span>
        A stable telephone or internet connection and suitable audio equipment are sufficient.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Features of Video-conferencing</h2>
    <p>
      Video-conferencing has some additional features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Audio-visual communication:</span>
        Participants can both hear and see each other. This makes communication closer to an
        actual physical meeting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Use of cameras and screens:</span>
        Each location needs a camera (webcam or better), microphone, speakers and a monitor or
        projector.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Stronger sense of presence:</span>
        Facial expressions, gestures and body language are visible, which improves understanding
        and reduces chances of misunderstanding.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Integrated collaboration tools:</span>
        Modern platforms allow screen-sharing, chat messages, polls, breakout rooms and recording
        of sessions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Higher bandwidth requirement:</span>
        Because both sound and video data are transmitted, fast and stable internet is needed for
        smooth communication.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Advantages of Teleconferencing</h2>
    <p>
      Teleconferencing offers several advantages to organisations and individuals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Saving of time and money:</span>
        People do not need to travel to attend meetings. Train fares, air tickets, hotel bills
        and travelling time are saved.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Quick decision-making:</span>
        When urgent decisions are required, a teleconference can be arranged at short notice.
        Managers from different cities or countries can join within minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Flexibility:</span>
        Participants can join from their homes, offices or even while travelling, as long as they
        have a telephone or internet connection.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Wider participation:</span>
        Experts and resource persons from distant places can be included without the difficulty
        of bringing them physically to one location.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Environmental benefit:</span>
        Less travel means less fuel consumption and reduced environmental pollution.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Advantages of Video-conferencing</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to the above general advantages, video-conferencing has some special benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Face-to-face impression:</span>
        Seeing the speaker’s face and body language increases trust and clarity. It is easier to
        judge reactions, agreement or confusion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Better for teaching and training:</span>
        Teachers can show demonstrations, slides and diagrams while talking. Students can raise
        hands, ask questions and see the teacher’s expressions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Stronger group feeling:</span>
        Teams working from different locations can see each other on the screen and thus feel
        more connected.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Recording facility:</span>
        Many platforms allow recording of complete meetings or lectures. These recordings can be
        used later for revision or as official record.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Support for remote services:</span>
        Fields such as tele-medicine, online counselling, technical support and customer service
        make extensive use of video-conferencing to reach clients in distant areas.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Limitations of Teleconferencing</h2>
    <p>
      Despite its usefulness, teleconferencing has some limitations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Absence of visual cues:</span>
        Since participants cannot see each other, important non-verbal signals such as facial
        expressions and gestures are lost. This may lead to misunderstanding of tone or attitude.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Difficulty in controlling discussion:</span>
        When many people speak on an audio line, voices may clash. It is sometimes difficult to
        know who is speaking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Limited effectiveness for long sessions:</span>
        Long audio-only meetings become tiring and monotonous, especially when participants
        cannot see each other.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Technical issues:</span>
        Poor connections, echo, background noise or delay in sound can disturb the flow of
        communication.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Limitations of Video-conferencing</h2>
    <p>
      Video-conferencing also has drawbacks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">High cost of equipment and connectivity:</span>
        Good cameras, microphones, displays and high-speed internet may be expensive, especially
        for small institutions or in rural areas.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Dependence on technology:</span>
        If electricity fails, internet breaks down or software crashes, the whole meeting may be
        interrupted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Loss of personal touch:</span>
        Although better than audio-only, video-conferencing still cannot fully replace the warmth
        and informal contact of a physical meeting, especially for building new relationships.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Distractions and fatigue:</span>
        Long video meetings can cause “screen fatigue”. Participants may become distracted by
        their surroundings or start multi-tasking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Privacy and security concerns:</span>
        If proper security settings are not used, unauthorised persons may join or recordings
        may be misused.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Difference between Teleconferencing and Video-conferencing</h2>
    <p>
      The main points of difference can be presented as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Nature of communication:</span><br>
        Teleconferencing is primarily <em>audio-based</em>; video-conferencing is <em>audio-visual</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Sense of presence:</span><br>
        Teleconferencing gives only a “voice presence”; video-conferencing provides a “virtual
        face-to-face” presence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Technical requirements:</span><br>
        Teleconferencing can work with simple telephones or low-bandwidth internet. 
        Video-conferencing requires cameras, screens and higher bandwidth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Cost:</span><br>
        Teleconferencing is relatively cheaper. Video-conferencing may involve higher initial
        investment in equipment and connectivity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Suitability:</span><br>
        Teleconferencing is suitable for short, routine meetings and quick consultations.
        Video-conferencing is more suitable for teaching, detailed presentations, training
        programmes and high-level discussions where visual contact is important.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To conclude, <span class="highlight">teleconferencing</span> and 
      <span class="highlight">video-conferencing</span> are two important tools of modern oral
      communication which allow people at distant locations to meet, discuss and take decisions
      without travelling. Teleconferencing uses mainly voice and is simpler and cheaper, while
      video-conferencing combines voice with live images and creates a stronger sense of
      face-to-face contact. Both save time and cost, extend access to experts and support
      education, business and administration. At the same time, they suffer from limitations
      such as technical problems, lack of complete personal contact and, in the case of
      video-conferencing, higher equipment and bandwidth requirements. A balanced and intelligent
      use of these technologies enables individuals and organisations to communicate more
      effectively in the global, technology-driven world that the Ability Enhancement Course
      prepares students to face.
