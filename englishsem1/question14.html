    <!-- ANSWER STARTS -->

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In today’s academic and professional world, a large part of communication does not take
      place one-to-one but one-to-many. Students have to present seminars, managers have to
      address meetings, and leaders must speak to groups of people. This activity of addressing
      an audience in a structured and purposeful manner is called
      <span class="highlight">public speaking</span>. The Ability Enhancement Course in English
      gives special importance to public speaking because it brings together all the major
      listening and speaking skills in a single activity.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Meaning of Public Speaking</h2>
    <p>
      In simple terms, <span class="highlight">public speaking</span> may be defined as:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>“The art of standing before an audience and delivering a well-organised speech with the
      purpose of informing, influencing or entertaining listeners.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is different from casual conversation in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is <span class="highlight">planned and prepared</span> in advance, not improvised.</li>
      <li>It is addressed to a <span class="highlight">group or audience</span>, not a single person.</li>
      <li>It has a <span class="highlight">clear objective</span> such as to explain, persuade,
        motivate, welcome, propose a vote of thanks, etc.</li>
      <li>It requires conscious control of <span class="highlight">language, voice and body
        language</span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Features of Public Speaking</h2>
    <p>
      Effective public speaking has certain characteristic features which distinguish it from
      ordinary talk.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Purposeful and Audience-Centred</h3>
    <p>
      Every public speech is delivered with a definite <span class="highlight">purpose</span>:
      to inform (as in a lecture or presentation), to persuade (as in a motivational or political
      speech) or to entertain (as in a humorous speech or after-dinner talk). A good speaker
      keeps this purpose clearly in mind and shapes the content accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, public speaking is <span class="highlight">audience-centred</span>. The
      speaker considers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>who the listeners are (students, teachers, managers, lay public, etc.),</li>
      <li>what they already know about the topic, and</li>
      <li>what they need or expect to gain from the speech.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Language, examples and level of detail are selected keeping the audience in mind.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Formal Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Public speaking follows a <span class="highlight">formal structure</span>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a clear <span class="highlight">introduction</span> which attracts attention, states the
        topic and establishes the speaker’s relationship with the audience,</li>
      <li>a well-developed <span class="highlight">body</span> where main points are explained
        with supporting evidence, and</li>
      <li>a brief, memorable <span class="highlight">conclusion</span> which summarises key ideas
        and leaves a final impression.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This structure allows listeners to follow the speech easily and remember the important
      points.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Use of Spoken Style, Not Written Style</h3>
    <p>
      Although a public speech may be written down in notes, the actual delivery uses a
      <span class="highlight">spoken style</span>, not the complex, long sentences of written
      essays.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sentences are shorter and more direct.</li>
      <li>Contractions (“don’t”, “can’t”) and conversational expressions may be used as
        appropriate.</li>
      <li>Signposting expressions (“now let us see…”, “on the other hand…”, “finally…”) help the
        audience to keep track.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Thus, public speaking occupies a middle position between everyday conversation and formal
      written language.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Interaction with the Audience</h3>
    <p>
      Unlike written communication, public speaking allows <span class="highlight">immediate
      feedback</span>. The speaker can see the audience’s reactions and adjust pace, examples or
      explanation accordingly.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Questions may be invited at the end or sometimes during the speech.</li>
      <li>Short interactions like “How many of you agree with this?” help to keep listeners
        involved.</li>
      <li>Eye contact and body language strengthen this sense of connection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Importance of Voice and Non-verbal Communication</h3>
    <p>
      Public speaking depends heavily on <span class="highlight">voice quality, intonation,
      volume, pace</span> and <span class="highlight">non-verbal cues</span> such as posture,
      gestures and facial expressions. The same words can have a different impact depending on
      how they are delivered. A monotonous, lifeless voice can make even an interesting topic
      dull, whereas a lively, well-modulated voice can keep the audience engaged even during a
      long session.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Essentials of Effective Public Speaking</h2>
    <p>
      To speak effectively in public, a student should develop several essential skills. These
      are discussed below in a systematic way.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Planning and Preparation</h3>
    <p>
      The first essential is thorough <span class="highlight">planning</span>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Understanding the assignment:</span>
        Know the topic, length of time, type of audience and occasion (seminar, farewell, formal
        function, classroom presentation).
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Collecting material:</span>
        Read books, articles, reports and reliable websites to gather facts, examples and
        quotations related to the topic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Selecting and organising points:</span>
        Choose a few strong points rather than many weak ones. Arrange them logically – from
        simple to complex, known to unknown, cause to effect or past to present.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Preparing an outline:</span>
        Instead of writing every word, prepare an outline with key headings, sub-points and
        examples. This outline guides the speech and prevents forgetting important items.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Effective Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight">beginning</span> of a speech is crucial because it sets the
      tone and captures attention.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Greet the audience and, in formal situations, acknowledge the chairperson and dignitaries.</li>
      <li>State the <span class="highlight">topic</span> clearly.</li>
      <li>Use a brief attention-getter: a short quotation, a question, a surprising fact or a
        very short relevant story.</li>
      <li>Give a quick <span class="highlight">preview</span> of the main points you will cover.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A weak or vague introduction often loses the audience within the first minute.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Clear Organisation of the Body</h3>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight">body</span> of the speech should develop the topic in a
      structured way.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each main idea should be stated clearly and supported with reasons, examples or data.</li>
      <li>Transitional expressions like “firstly”, “another important point is”, “now let us
        consider” help the audience to follow the sequence.</li>
      <li>Technical terms should be explained in simple language when used.</li>
      <li>Time must be distributed fairly among the points so that the last part is not rushed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Impactful Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      An effective speech does not fade out weakly; it ends with a
      <span class="highlight">strong conclusion</span>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Briefly <span class="highlight">summarise</span> the main points.</li>
      <li>Restate the central message or your stand on the issue.</li>
      <li>End with a memorable thought – a quotation, an appeal, a hope for the future or a
        powerful sentence.</li>
      <li>Thank the audience for their patient listening.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Voice Modulation and Pronunciation</h3>
    <p>
      Voice is the main tool of a public speaker. Effective speakers pay attention to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Volume</span> – loud enough to be heard clearly, without shouting.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Pitch and intonation</span> – rise and fall of voice to
        highlight important words and to express emotion.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Pace</span> – moderate speed; slowing down for complex points
        and pausing briefly after key statements.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Pronunciation and stress</span> – correct sounds, proper word
        stress and clear articulation of consonants and vowels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Regular practice, reading aloud and imitation of good speakers (such as newsreaders and
      experienced teachers) can improve these aspects.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Effective Use of Body Language</h3>
    <p>
      Non-verbal communication strongly influences how a speech is received.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Posture:</span>
        Stand straight but relaxed. Avoid leaning on the podium or swaying continuously.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Eye contact:</span>
        Look at different sections of the audience from time to time. This creates connection
        and keeps people attentive.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Gestures:</span>
        Use natural hand movements to emphasise important points, but avoid over-acting or
        distracting gestures.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Facial expression:</span>
        A pleasant, confident expression encourages the audience to listen. A tense or blank face
        reduces impact.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. Overcoming Stage Fright</h3>
    <p>
      Many students know their material well but suffer from <span class="highlight">stage
      fright</span> – nervousness or fear of facing an audience. This is natural and can be
      reduced.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prepare thoroughly; confidence grows from knowledge.</li>
      <li>Practise the speech several times, preferably in front of a mirror or a small group of
        friends.</li>
      <li>Arrive early, become familiar with the room, podium and microphone.</li>
      <li>Take a few deep breaths before beginning and start with a well-practised opening line.</li>
      <li>Remember that the audience usually wants the speaker to succeed, not to fail.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. Handling Notes and Visual Aids</h3>
    <p>
      In many public speaking situations, the speaker may use brief notes or visual aids such as
      slides.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Notes should be in <span class="highlight">point form</span>, not full paragraphs, so
        that the speaker can quickly glance and return to eye contact with the audience.</li>
      <li>Visual aids (charts, slides, diagrams) should be clear, simple and directly related to
        the speech. They are meant to support, not replace, the speaker.</li>
      <li>Technical problems should be anticipated; the speaker should be ready to continue even
        if a slide does not appear.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Importance of Public Speaking for Students</h2>
    <p>
      For students of B.Com/BBA/BCA, public speaking skills have lasting value:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>They prepare students for classroom seminars, project presentations and viva voce.</li>
      <li>They build confidence for group discussions and job interviews.</li>
      <li>They are essential in careers such as teaching, marketing, management, law and public
        administration.</li>
      <li>They help in community leadership, social service and participation in public life.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Ability Enhancement Course therefore treats public speaking not as an optional
      activity, but as a core component of communication training.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To conclude, <span class="highlight">public speaking</span> is the planned, formal act of
      addressing an audience with a clear purpose of informing, persuading or entertaining. It is
      characterised by a definite structure, audience-centred content, spoken style, interaction
      with listeners and careful use of voice and body language. Effective public speaking
      requires thorough planning, a strong introduction, organised body, impactful conclusion,
      good voice modulation, appropriate non-verbal behaviour, control over nervousness and
      proper handling of notes and visual aids. For students of the Ability Enhancement Course,
      mastering these essentials leads not only to better examination performance but also to
      lifelong confidence in academic, professional and social situations where they are called
      upon to speak before others.
