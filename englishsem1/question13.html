    <!-- ANSWER STARTS -->

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Human beings are social creatures. They live in families, classrooms, offices and
      communities where constant interaction is necessary. Among the four language skills –
      listening, speaking, reading and writing – <span class="highlight">speaking</span> is the
      most visible and immediate. It is through speaking that we present ourselves to others,
      share information, express attitudes, influence people and build relationships. In the
      context of the Ability Enhancement Course, speaking skills occupy a central place because
      employers, teachers and society often judge a person’s competence on the basis of how well
      he or she can speak.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Meaning of Speaking</h2>
    <p>
      In simple terms, <span class="highlight">speaking</span> may be defined as the 
      <span class="highlight">oral expression of thoughts, feelings, ideas and information through
      a systematic use of language sounds</span>. It is a productive skill, because the speaker
      actively produces language rather than merely receiving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more detailed description would be:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>“Speaking is a purposeful, interactive process in which a speaker selects appropriate
      words, organises them into meaningful sentences, pronounces them clearly with correct
      stress and intonation, and delivers them to a listener in a particular social situation.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, speaking is not simply saying whatever comes to mind. It is a controlled, deliberate
      activity that requires attention to language, audience and purpose.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Characteristics of Good Speaking</h2>
    <p>
      Effective speaking is a combination of several elements. A speaker who wishes to improve
      must understand these characteristics clearly.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Clarity and Accuracy</h3>
    <p>
      The first requirement of good speaking is <span class="highlight">clarity</span>. The
      listener should be able to understand the message without confusion.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Clear pronunciation:</span>
        Sounds, words and sentence stress should be produced in a way that is easy to follow.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Correct language use:</span>
        While occasional mistakes are natural, frequent errors in grammar or word choice may
        distract the listener and weaken the message.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Logical sentences:</span>
        Ideas should be expressed in complete, meaningful sentences rather than broken phrases.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Fluency and Naturalness</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Fluency</span> refers to the smooth, continuous flow of speech.
      A fluent speaker:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>speaks at a reasonable speed – not too fast, not too slow,</li>
      <li>does not pause for a long time between every word, and</li>
      <li>avoids excessive fillers like “um”, “you know”, “actually”, “like” in every sentence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Fluency does not mean speaking without pauses at all; short pauses are natural and may be
      used for emphasis. What matters is that speech should sound natural, not mechanical or
      painfully slow.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Appropriateness to Situation and Audience</h3>
    <p>
      Good speaking is <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> to the context. The way we
      speak to a close friend is not the same as the way we speak to a teacher, interviewer or
      client.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In <span class="highlight">formal situations</span> (presentations, interviews, official
        meetings), more polite and standard language is used, with complete sentences and fewer
        slang expressions.
      </li>
      <li>
        In <span class="highlight">informal situations</span> (chatting with friends, family
        talk), relaxed style and colloquial expressions are acceptable.
      </li>
      <li>
        The speaker must consider the <span class="highlight">age, status and background</span>
        of the listener and adjust tone and vocabulary accordingly.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Organisation and Coherence</h3>
    <p>
      Effective speaking is not a random collection of sentences. Ideas must be 
      <span class="highlight">organised</span> and <span class="highlight">coherent</span>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>There should be a clear beginning, middle and end.</li>
      <li>Points should follow a logical order – for example, from general to specific, past to
        present, cause to effect.</li>
      <li>Linking expressions such as “firstly”, “on the other hand”, “therefore”, “in
        conclusion” guide the listener from one idea to the next.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Without such organisation, even good ideas may appear confused and fail to impress.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Effective Use of Voice and Non-verbal Cues</h3>
    <p>
      Speaking is not only about words; it also involves the <span class="highlight">voice</span>
      and <span class="highlight">body language</span>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Voice quality:</span>
        A pleasant, well-modulated voice holds the listener’s attention. Sudden shouting or a
        monotonous tone should be avoided.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Intonation:</span>
        The rise and fall of voice should match the meaning and emotion of the sentence. Proper
        intonation makes speech lively and meaningful.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Body language:</span>
        Natural facial expressions, appropriate gestures and steady posture support the spoken
        message. Negative signals like crossed arms, avoiding eye contact or constant fidgeting
        can distract the audience.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Confidence and Courtesy</h3>
    <p>
      A confident speaker is easier to believe. Confidence comes from preparation, practice and
      positive attitude. At the same time, <span class="highlight">courtesy</span> is essential.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use polite forms of address – “sir”, “madam”, “friends”, “respected chairperson”.</li>
      <li>Allow others to speak; avoid interrupting and dominating the conversation.</li>
      <li>Accept questions and criticism calmly, without becoming defensive or rude.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Types of Speaking Situations</h2>
    <p>
      In the Ability Enhancement Course, students encounter a variety of speaking activities.
      Broadly, speaking situations can be grouped as follows:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Interpersonal or Conversational Speaking</h3>
    <p>
      This refers to everyday conversation with friends, classmates, teachers, colleagues and
      family members. The main purpose is to maintain relationships, exchange small bits of
      information and express feelings. Turn-taking, politeness and attentive listening are
      important here.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Transactional Speaking</h3>
    <p>
      Here the aim is to <span class="highlight">complete a task</span> or 
      <span class="highlight">exchange specific information</span>. Examples include asking for
      directions, booking a ticket, making an enquiry in an office or clarifying a doubt in
      class. Accuracy and clarity are more important than long, decorative language.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Public Speaking and Presentations</h3>
    <p>
      Public speaking involves addressing a larger audience – delivering a short speech,
      presentation, debate, welcome address or vote of thanks. This requires careful planning,
      structured content, confident delivery and effective use of voice and body language.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Academic and Professional Speaking</h3>
    <p>
      In seminars, group discussions, meetings and interviews, speaking must be formal, logical
      and well-supported by facts. Here, the speaker is often assessed not only on knowledge but
      also on language, confidence and ability to respond to questions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub">Importance of Speaking Skills</h2>
    <p>
      Speaking skills are important in several domains of life. Their importance can be
      discussed under the following heads:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Academic Importance</h3>
    <p>
      In the classroom, students are expected to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>answer questions orally,</li>
      <li>participate in discussions and debates,</li>
      <li>give short presentations or seminars, and</li>
      <li>interact with teachers and peers on academic topics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A student who can speak clearly and confidently usually performs better in viva voce,
      classroom activities and internal assessment.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Professional and Career Importance</h3>
    <p>
      In the modern job market, employers look for candidates who possess strong communication
      skills, especially in English.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In <span class="highlight">interviews</span>, the ability to speak politely and
        confidently often outweighs purely written achievements.
      </li>
      <li>
        In <span class="highlight">group discussions</span>, recruiters observe how candidates
        speak in a team – whether they can lead, persuade, listen and respond.
      </li>
      <li>
        In <span class="highlight">office situations</span>, employees must speak to clients,
        superiors and colleagues, participate in meetings and give briefings or presentations.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Thus, good speaking skills significantly increase employability and opportunities for
      promotion.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Social and Personal Importance</h3>
    <p>
      Speaking skills also have a strong <span class="highlight">social</span> and
      <span class="highlight">personal</span> dimension.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>They help us to form friendships and maintain healthy relationships.</li>
      <li>They enable us to express our feelings, needs and opinions in a balanced way.</li>
      <li>They boost self-confidence and reduce feelings of inferiority or shyness.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A person who can speak well is often seen as intelligent, capable and trustworthy, even
      before his or her written work is examined.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Role in Learning Other Skills</h3>
    <p>
      Speaking is closely linked with <span class="highlight">listening</span>. Many classroom
      activities in the Ability Enhancement Course, such as role-plays, dialogues, group tasks
      and pair work, combine listening and speaking. By speaking, students:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>practise vocabulary and structures learned in reading and grammar lessons,</li>
      <li>receive immediate feedback from teachers and classmates, and</li>
      <li>become more aware of their own language strengths and weaknesses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sub">Developing Good Speaking Skills</h2>
    <p>
      Speaking skills can be improved through deliberate practice. Some practical measures are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Regular practice:</span>
        Speak English daily in small situations – greeting teachers, asking simple questions,
        taking part in short conversations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Listening to good models:</span>
        News bulletins, documentaries, talks and films in good English provide patterns of
        pronunciation, stress and intonation which learners can imitate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Expanding vocabulary:</span>
        Reading widely adds new words and expressions, which can then be used in speech.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Planning before speaking:</span>
        For formal speaking, such as presentations, a brief outline should be prepared in
        advance, with a clear introduction and conclusion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Self-monitoring:</span>
        Paying attention to one’s own errors, recording one’s speech occasionally and seeking
        feedback from teachers or friends helps in steady improvement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Overcoming fear:</span>
        Many students know English but hesitate to speak. Participating regularly in small
        speaking tasks gradually removes this psychological barrier.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To conclude, <span class="highlight">speaking</span> is the oral, interactive expression
      of ideas and feelings through language. It is characterised by clarity, fluency,
      appropriateness, organisation, effective use of voice and non-verbal cues, and a balanced
      combination of confidence and courtesy. Speaking skills are vital in academic performance,
      professional success and social life. For students of the Ability Enhancement Course,
      conscious development of speaking skills – through classroom practice, exposure to good
      models and self-correction – is not an optional luxury but a necessity. A person who can
      speak well in English gains not only marks in examinations, but also lifelong confidence
      and opportunities in a competitive world.
