    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <p class="section-title">Introduction</p>
    <p>
      In modern (ordinal) theory of consumer behaviour, the concept of <strong>indifference curve</strong> plays a
      central role. Unlike the earlier <em>cardinal utility</em> approach, which assumes that utility can be measured
      in absolute numbers (utils), the indifference curve approach assumes only that the consumer can
      <strong>rank different bundles of goods according to preference</strong>. This makes the analysis more realistic
      and is widely used in contemporary microeconomics.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Panjab University B.Com Semester I, students are expected to give a precise definition of indifference curve,
      construct an indifference schedule and diagram, and then <strong>systematically explain its main properties</strong>,
      such as downward slope, convexity to the origin, non-intersection and the meaning of higher curves. The answer
      below follows the style and depth of <strong>T.R. Jain &amp; V.K. Ohri, Microeconomics</strong>, as prescribed for
      your syllabus.
    </p>

    <!-- MEANING / DEFINITION -->
    <p class="section-title">Meaning and Definition of Indifference Curve</p>
    <p>
      Consider a consumer who consumes two goods, say <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> (for example, X = tea,
      Y = biscuits). He can choose among different combinations (bundles) of X and Y. Some combinations may give him
      more satisfaction than others, while a few combinations may give him <strong>exactly the same level of satisfaction</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class="boxed">
      <strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      An <strong>indifference curve</strong> is a locus of all those different combinations of two goods
      which yield the <strong>same level of satisfaction</strong> to the consumer. The consumer is
      <em>indifferent</em> among all such combinations because each of them is equally satisfactory to him.
    </div>

    <p>
      Thus, every point on an indifference curve represents a particular bundle of X and Y which provides
      <strong>identical utility</strong> to the consumer. He has no reason to prefer one point on the same curve over another.
    </p>

    <!-- INDIFFERENCE SCHEDULE -->
    <p class="section-title">Indifference Schedule (Illustration)</p>
    <p>
      The concept can first be expressed with the help of an <strong>indifference schedule</strong>. Suppose a consumer
      is choosing between commodity X (say, units of tea) and commodity Y (say, units of biscuits). The following
      hypothetical combinations all give him the same level of satisfaction:
    </p>

    <table aria-label="Indifference schedule for goods X and Y">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Combination</th>
          <th>Commodity X (units)</th>
          <th>Commodity Y (units)</th>
          <th>Level of Satisfaction</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>A</td><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>Same satisfaction</td></tr>
        <tr><td>B</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>Same satisfaction</td></tr>
        <tr><td>C</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>Same satisfaction</td></tr>
        <tr><td>D</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>Same satisfaction</td></tr>
        <tr><td>E</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>Same satisfaction</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Here, combination A (1, 9), B (2, 7), C (3, 5), D (4, 3) and E (5, 2) all yield the same utility.
      If these points are plotted on a graph and joined smoothly, we obtain an <strong>indifference curve</strong>.
    </p>

    <!-- DIAGRAM -->
    <p class="section-title">Indifference Curve Diagram</p>
    <p>
      In the indifference curve diagram, quantity of good X is measured on the horizontal axis and quantity of
      good Y on the vertical axis. Joining combinations A, B, C, D and E we get a typical downward sloping,
      convex indifference curve.

    <!-- PROPERTIES -->
    <p class="section-title">Properties of Indifference Curves</p>
    <p>
      On the basis of the consumer’s behaviour and underlying assumptions of ordinal utility theory,
      indifference curves possess certain well-defined properties. The main properties usually discussed
      in B.Com Semester I (as in T.R. Jain &amp; V.K. Ohri) are the following:
    </p>

    <!-- 1. Downward Sloping -->
    <p class="subheading">1. Indifference Curves Slope Downwards from Left to Right</p>
    <p>
      An indifference curve is <strong>negatively sloped</strong>. This means that if the quantity of
      good X increases, the quantity of good Y must decrease so that the consumer remains at the same
      level of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason is that both goods are assumed to be “goods” (not “bads”): more of a good increases
      satisfaction. If the consumer is to remain indifferent, the loss of one good must be compensated
      by a gain of the other. Hence, IC slopes downward.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
      <strong>Example:</strong>  
      If a consumer moves from combination B (2 units of X, 7 units of Y) to combination C (3 units of X,
      5 units of Y), he gains 1 unit of X but loses 2 units of Y. This loss in Y must just offset the
      gain in X so that his total satisfaction remains unchanged.
    </div>

    <!-- 2. Higher IC Represents Higher Level of Satisfaction -->
    <p class="subheading">2. Higher Indifference Curves Represent Higher Levels of Satisfaction</p>
    <p>
      A family of indifference curves is called an <strong>indifference map</strong>. In such a map,
      any indifference curve lying to the <strong>right and above</strong> another represents
      a <strong>higher level of satisfaction</strong>, because it contains combinations with larger
      quantities of at least one good.
    </p>
    <p>
      If IC₂ lies above IC₁, every point on IC₂ involves more of at least one commodity than the
      corresponding point on IC₁. Since both goods are desirable, IC₂ is preferred to IC₁.
    </p>

    <div class="importance-box">
      <strong>Exam note:</strong>  
      While on any single indifference curve the consumer is indifferent among combinations,
      between two different curves he always prefers the one lying further from the origin.
    </div>

    <!-- 3. ICs Cannot Intersect -->
    <p class="subheading">3. Indifference Curves Never Intersect Each Other</p>
    <p>
      Two indifference curves cannot intersect. If they did, it would contradict the assumption
      of a <strong>consistent preference ordering</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose IC₁ and IC₂ intersect at point A. Let B be another point on IC₁ and C another point on IC₂.
      Since A and B lie on IC₁, the consumer is indifferent between A and B. Since A and C lie on IC₂,
      he is also indifferent between A and C. By transitivity, he must be indifferent between B and C.
      But inspection of the diagram would show that B contains more of both goods than C (or vice versa),
      so the consumer must strictly prefer B to C. This is a contradiction.
    </p>

    <div class="boxed">
      <strong>Conclusion:</strong>  
      Because intersection of indifference curves implies inconsistent preferences, it is ruled out.
      Therefore, no two indifference curves can cut or intersect each other.
    </div>

    <!-- 4. Convex to Origin -->
    <p class="subheading">4. Indifference Curves are Convex to the Origin</p>
    <p>
      A typical indifference curve is <strong>convex to the origin</strong>, i.e. it bends towards
      the origin. This shape reflects the law of <strong>diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Marginal Rate of Substitution of X for Y (MRS<sub>xy</sub>)</strong> is the amount of Y
      which the consumer is willing to sacrifice in order to obtain one extra unit of X, while remaining
      on the same indifference curve (same level of satisfaction). As the consumer has more and more of X
      and less and less of Y, he is prepared to give up <strong>fewer and fewer units of Y</strong> for
      each additional unit of X. Thus, MRS<sub>xy</sub> diminishes as we move down along the IC.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
      <strong>Illustrative MRS Schedule:</strong><br>
      Moving from A to B: X increases by 1, Y falls from 9 to 7 ⇒ MRS = 2 Y for 1 X.<br>
      Moving from B to C: X increases by 1, Y falls from 7 to 5 ⇒ MRS = 2/1 (still high).<br>
      Moving from C to D: X increases by 1, Y falls from 5 to 3 ⇒ MRS remains 2.<br>
      In a more realistic schedule, MRS would gradually fall (e.g. 4, 3, 2, 1). This declining MRS is
      represented by the convex shape of the indifference curve.
    </div>

    <p>
      Hence, convexity of an indifference curve to the origin is simply a graphical representation of the
      principle of diminishing marginal rate of substitution.
    </p>

    <!-- 5. ICs are Not Thick -->
    <p class="subheading">5. Indifference Curves are Thin (They Have No Thickness)</p>
    <p>
      An indifference curve is drawn as a <strong>thin line</strong>, not as a thick band. If an
      indifference curve had thickness, then two points on the same “band” could represent different
      levels of satisfaction, which would contradict the definition of an indifference curve (all points
      must yield exactly the same utility).
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, in theory, an indifference curve is a precise locus and has no thickness.
    </p>

    <!-- 6. Infinite Number of ICs -->
    <p class="subheading">6. There is a Family (Map) of Indifference Curves</p>
    <p>
      For a given consumer and given set of goods, there is not just one indifference curve. There is a
      whole <strong>indifference map</strong> consisting of an infinite number of curves, each representing
      a different level of satisfaction (U₁, U₂, U₃, …). Curves lying further from the origin represent
      successively <strong>higher levels of satisfaction</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This property is important because it allows us to analyse changes in the consumer’s welfare: movement
      to a higher indifference curve means increase in satisfaction; movement to a lower curve implies loss
      of welfare.
    </p>

    <!-- 7. Normally Convex, Not Concave -->
    <p class="subheading">7. Indifference Curves are Normally Convex, not Concave</p>
    <p>
      While the usual assumption is convexity, in special cases indifference curves can be:
    </p>
    <ul class="points">
      <li><strong>Perfect substitutes:</strong> Straight-line indifference curves with constant MRS.</li>
      <li><strong>Perfect complements:</strong> L-shaped (right-angle) indifference curves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, for normal goods analysed in undergraduate microeconomics, the standard assumption is that
      indifference curves are <strong>strictly convex</strong>, consistent with a diminishing MRS and
      a diversified consumption pattern.
    </p>

    <!-- IMPORTANCE -->
    <p class="section-title">Importance of Indifference Curves (Brief Note)</p>
    <p>
      Although the question mainly asks for definition and properties, it is useful (and marks-fetching)
      to briefly mention the <strong>importance</strong> of indifference curves:
    </p>
    <div class="importance-box">
      <ul class="points">
        <li>They form the basis of the modern theory of <strong>consumer equilibrium</strong> (with the budget line).</li>
        <li>They help distinguish and analyse <strong>income effect, substitution effect and price effect</strong>.</li>
        <li>They provide a more realistic framework based on <strong>ordinal utility</strong> and do not require cardinal measurement of utility.</li>
        <li>They allow us to analyse the effect of changes in prices and income on the welfare of the consumer.</li>

    <!-- EXAM TIP -->
    <div class="exam-tip">
      <strong>Exam Tip:</strong>
      For a 15-marks question in Panjab University, you should write:
      (i) a clear definition, (ii) an indifference schedule, (iii) a neat, labelled diagram,
      and (iv) a well-organised explanation of at least <strong>four to six properties</strong>, stressing
      downward slope, convexity, non-intersection and higher-curve-higher-satisfaction. A brief concluding
      remark on the importance of ICs can further improve your marks.
    </div>

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <p class="section-title">Conclusion</p>
    <p>
      To sum up, an <strong>indifference curve</strong> is a fundamental tool in modern microeconomics. It
      represents all those combinations of two goods which provide the consumer with the same level of satisfaction.
      Its main properties—downward slope, convexity to the origin, non-intersection and the interpretation of higher
      curves—follow directly from rational, consistent and smoothly diminishing preferences. Indifference curve
      analysis, as developed in your prescribed text by T.R. Jain &amp; V.K. Ohri, replaces the unrealistic cardinal
      utility approach and provides a more solid basis for the theory of demand, consumer equilibrium and welfare.
