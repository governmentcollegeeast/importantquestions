    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <p class="section-title">Introduction</p>
    <p>
      The general concept of elasticity of demand measures the degree of responsiveness of quantity demanded
      to a change in any of its determinants. While price elasticity of demand considers changes in own price,
      <strong>income elasticity</strong> and <strong>cross elasticity</strong> extend this analysis to other
      crucial determinants—namely, consumer income and prices of related goods. T.R. Jain and V.K. Ohri
      treat these elasticities as essential tools for understanding how demand behaves in a realistic, multi-variable
      economic environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this note, we explain in detail the meaning, types and significance of (a) <strong>Income Elasticity of Demand</strong>,
      and (b) <strong>Cross Elasticity of Demand</strong>, along with their importance in theory and policy. This
      structured discussion is exactly in line with the expectations of Panjab University for a 15-marks long answer.
    </p>

    <!-- I. INCOME ELASTICITY -->
    <p class="section-title">I. Income Elasticity of Demand</p>

    <p class="subheading">1. Meaning and Definition</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Income Elasticity of Demand</strong> (usually denoted by E<sub>y</sub>) measures the degree of
      responsiveness of quantity demanded of a commodity to a change in the income of the consumer, other factors
      such as price and tastes remaining constant.
    </p>

    <div class="boxed">
      <strong>Formal definition:</strong><br>
      Income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded of a commodity divided by the
      percentage change in the income of the consumer, <em>ceteris paribus</em>.
      <br><br>
      <span style="font-family:ui-monospace,monospace;background:#f3f7fb;padding:6px 10px;border-radius:6px;display:inline-block;">
        E<sub>y</sub> = (% change in Q) ÷ (% change in Y)
      </span>
    </div>

    <p class="subheading">2. Measurement (Basic Formula)</p>
    <p>
      For finite changes, income elasticity of demand can be measured as:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:ui-monospace,monospace;background:#f3f7fb;padding:6px 10px;border-radius:6px;display:inline-block;">
      E<sub>y</sub> = (ΔQ / Q) ÷ (ΔY / Y) = (ΔQ / ΔY) × (Y / Q)
    </p>
    <p>
      Where ΔQ = change in quantity demanded, ΔY = change in income, Q = initial quantity demanded and Y = initial income.
      In certain contexts, an arc formula using averages of Q and Y may be used to measure income elasticity over a range.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">3. Types of Income Elasticity of Demand</p>
    <p>
      Depending on the sign and magnitude of E<sub>y</sub>, we classify income elasticity into several types:
    </p>

    <ol class="points">
      <li>
        <strong>Positive Income Elasticity (E<sub>y</sub> &gt; 0):</strong>
        Quantity demanded increases when income increases. Such goods are called <strong>normal goods</strong>.
        Within this category:
        <ul class="points">
          <li><strong>0 &lt; E<sub>y</sub> &lt; 1:</strong> Necessities; demand rises less than proportionately with income.</li>
          <li><strong>E<sub>y</sub> = 1:</strong> Unit income elasticity; demand rises in the same proportion as income.</li>
          <li><strong>E<sub>y</sub> &gt; 1:</strong> Luxuries or superior goods; demand rises more than proportionately with income.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Negative Income Elasticity (E<sub>y</sub> &lt; 0):</strong>
        Quantity demanded decreases when income increases. Such goods are <strong>inferior goods</strong> in the
        Hicksian sense. As people become richer, they substitute these goods with better-quality alternatives.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Zero Income Elasticity (E<sub>y</sub> = 0):</strong>
        Quantity demanded remains unchanged when income changes. Demand for such goods is completely independent
        of income (e.g. life-saving drugs within a certain range).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="example">
      <strong>Illustrative examples:</strong><br>
      • Rice or wheat for low-income consumers typically shows positive but less than unit income elasticity (necessity).<br>
      • High-end imported chocolates and premium cars may show income elasticity greater than one (luxury goods).<br>
      • Coarse grains or very low-quality clothing may exhibit negative income elasticity for higher income groups (inferior goods).
    </div>

    <p class="subheading">4. Importance of Income Elasticity of Demand</p>
    <p>
      Income elasticity of demand plays an important role in several areas of economic analysis and policy:
    </p>

    <div class="importance">
      <strong>(a) Business Forecasting and Planning</strong><br>
      Firms use income elasticity to forecast how sales of their products will change with economic growth. A
      product with high positive income elasticity will experience rapid growth in demand in periods of rising
      national income. This helps firms plan capacity expansion, investment and long-term strategy.
    </div>

    <div class="importance">
      <strong>(b) Classification of Goods into Necessities, Luxuries and Inferior Goods</strong><br>
      Income elasticity provides an analytical basis for classifying goods. Necessities typically have low but
      positive income elasticity, luxuries have income elasticity greater than one, and inferior goods have
      negative income elasticity. This classification is important for welfare analysis and tax policy.
    </div>

    <div class="importance">
      <strong>(c) Public Policy and Taxation</strong><br>
      Governments closely study the income elasticity of different goods while designing tax structures and
      subsidy policies. Highly income-elastic luxury goods can be taxed more heavily, whereas necessities consumed
      by low-income groups may be given concessions or subsidies.
    </div>

    <div class="importance">
      <strong>(d) Economic Development and Structural Change</strong><br>
      In developing economies, as per capita income rises, demand shifts away from basic necessities towards
      manufactured goods and services with higher income elasticity. Understanding these patterns (Engel’s law)
      helps planners anticipate structural changes in the economy.
    </div>

    <div class="importance">
      <strong>(e) International Trade Pattern</strong><br>
      Countries exporting goods with high income elasticity benefit more from global income growth. Knowledge of
      income elasticity structure thus influences trade and export promotion policies.
    </div>

    <!-- II. CROSS ELASTICITY -->
    <p class="section-title">II. Cross Elasticity of Demand</p>

    <p class="subheading">1. Meaning and Definition</p>
    <p>
      While income elasticity deals with responsiveness to changes in income, <strong>cross elasticity of demand</strong>
      (denoted by E<sub>xy</sub>) measures the responsiveness of demand for one good to changes in the price of
      <em>another</em> related good. It is therefore primarily concerned with the relationship between
      <strong>substitute goods</strong> and <strong>complementary goods</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class="boxed">
      <strong>Formal definition:</strong><br>
      Cross elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded of one commodity (X) divided by the
      percentage change in the price of another related commodity (Y), <em>ceteris paribus</em>.
      <br><br>
      <span style="font-family:ui-monospace,monospace;background:#f3f7fb;padding:6px 10px;border-radius:6px;display:inline-block;">
        E<sub>xy</sub> = (% change in Q<sub>x</sub>) ÷ (% change in P<sub>y</sub>)
      </span>
    </div>

    <p class="subheading">2. Measurement (Basic Formula)</p>
    <p>
      For measurable changes, cross elasticity can be written as:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:ui-monospace,monospace;background:#f3f7fb;padding:6px 10px;border-radius:6px;display:inline-block;">
      E<sub>xy</sub> = (ΔQ<sub>x</sub> / Q<sub>x</sub>) ÷ (ΔP<sub>y</sub> / P<sub>y</sub>) = (ΔQ<sub>x</sub> / ΔP<sub>y</sub>) × (P<sub>y</sub> / Q<sub>x</sub>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, Q<sub>x</sub> is quantity demanded of commodity X and P<sub>y</sub> is the price of related commodity Y. 
      The sign and magnitude of E<sub>xy</sub> provide crucial information on the nature and strength of the relationship between the two goods.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">3. Types of Cross Elasticity of Demand</p>
    <p>
      According to whether two goods are substitutes, complements or unrelated, cross elasticity may be:
    </p>

    <ol class="points">
      <li>
        <strong>Positive Cross Elasticity (E<sub>xy</sub> &gt; 0) — Substitutes:</strong>
        When the price of good Y rises, demand for good X increases (and vice versa). This indicates that X and Y are
        <strong>substitute goods</strong>, such as tea and coffee, Coke and Pepsi, or butter and margarine.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Negative Cross Elasticity (E<sub>xy</sub> &lt; 0) — Complements:</strong>
        When the price of good Y rises, demand for good X falls (and vice versa). This indicates that X and Y are
        <strong>complementary goods</strong>, such as car and petrol, printer and ink, mobile handset and data packs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Zero (or Almost Zero) Cross Elasticity (E<sub>xy</sub> ≈ 0) — Unrelated Goods:</strong>
        When a change in the price of Y has practically no effect on the demand for X, the goods are unrelated (e.g. bread and diesel).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="example">
      <strong>Illustrative examples:</strong><br>
      • If price of coffee increases and demand for tea rises, cross elasticity of tea with respect to coffee is positive (substitutes).<br>
      • If price of petrol increases and demand for cars falls, cross elasticity of cars with respect to petrol is negative (complements).<br>
      • If price of pencils changes and demand for refrigerators is unaffected, cross elasticity is zero (unrelated goods).
    </div>

    <p class="subheading">4. Importance of Cross Elasticity of Demand</p>
    <p>
      Cross elasticity plays a vital role in several analytical and practical contexts:
    </p>

    <div class="importance">
      <strong>(a) Classification of Goods as Substitutes or Complements</strong><br>
      Cross elasticity provides a quantitative measure of the nature and strength of the relationship between two goods.
      A positive coefficient confirms substitutability; a negative coefficient confirms complementarity. The higher the
      absolute value, the stronger the relationship.
    </div>

    <div class="importance">
      <strong>(b) Defining Industry and Market Boundaries</strong><br>
      In industrial economics and competition law, markets are defined in terms of groups of commodities that are close
      substitutes for each other. High positive cross elasticity among products indicates that they belong to the same
      competitive market or industry. This is essential for assessing monopoly power, mergers and anti-competitive practices.
    </div>

    <div class="importance">
      <strong>(c) Pricing Strategy and Rival Behaviour</strong><br>
      When cross elasticity between the products of different firms is high, a price change by one firm has a significant
      effect on the sales of rival firms. In such cases, firms must anticipate competitors’ reactions and adopt strategic
      pricing and advertising policies.
    </div>

    <div class="importance">
      <strong>(d) Joint Products and Complementary Pricing</strong><br>
      For complementary goods (like cameras and memory cards), producers often design joint marketing and pricing strategies.
      Knowledge of cross elasticity helps in determining optimal pricing combinations, bundle offers and tie-in sales.
    </div>

    <div class="importance">
      <strong>(e) Public Policy, Taxation and Regulation</strong><br>
      Government policies affecting the price of one good may have unintended consequences on related goods through cross
      elasticity channel. For instance, raising fuel prices affects car demand, and taxing cigarettes may change demand for
      substitute tobacco products. Policymakers must consider such cross effects for coherent policy design.
    </div>

    <!-- III. DISTINCTION -->
    <p class="section-title">III. Distinction Between Income and Cross Elasticity of Demand</p>
    <p>
      Though both are forms of elasticity of demand, income elasticity and cross elasticity differ fundamentally in the
      variable whose change is being considered and in their economic interpretation. A clear distinction is often required in exams.

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <p class="section-title">Conclusion</p>
    <p>
      To conclude, income elasticity and cross elasticity of demand are powerful extensions of the basic elasticity
      concept. Income elasticity relates demand to changes in consumer income and enables us to distinguish between
      necessities, luxuries and inferior goods, while cross elasticity relates demand to price changes of related
      commodities and helps us identify substitutes and complements and delineate market boundaries. A well-prepared
      answer should state precise definitions, give formulae, classify types on the basis of sign and magnitude, and
      highlight the practical importance of each elasticity in business decisions and public policy. Such a structured
      treatment fully matches the standard expected by Panjab University examiners.
