    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <p class="section-title">Introduction</p>
    <p>
      In the theory of the firm, <strong>cost of production</strong> occupies a central place. A producer’s decisions
      regarding output, price and scale of operations are all guided by the behaviour of costs. Modern microeconomics,
      as presented in <em>“Microeconomics” by T.R. Jain &amp; V.K. Ohri</em> for B.Com Semester I (Panjab University),
      explains cost behaviour with the help of a <strong>cost function</strong> and a number of well-defined
      <strong>concepts of cost</strong>. A good answer must first clarify what a cost function is and then systematically
      classify and explain the various cost concepts relevant to economic analysis.
    </p>

    <!-- MEANING OF COST FUNCTION -->
    <p class="section-title">1. Meaning and Definition of Cost Function</p>
    <p>
      In simple words, the <strong>cost function</strong> expresses the <strong>functional relationship</strong> between
      the cost of production and the level of output. Given the prices of factors of production and the technology in
      use, the cost of producing a particular quantity of output is determined. This relationship can be written in a
      general form as:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:ui-monospace,monospace;background:#f3f7fb;padding:8px 12px;border-radius:6px;display:inline-block;">
      C = f(Q)
    </p>
    <p>
      where:
    </p>
    <ul class="points">
      <li><strong>C</strong> = total cost of production,</li>
      <li><strong>Q</strong> = quantity of output, and</li>
      <li><strong>f</strong> = functional relationship depending upon technology and factor prices.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="boxed">
      <strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      A <strong>cost function</strong> is a mathematical or analytical expression which shows how the total cost of
      production varies with the level of output, given the technology and prices of inputs. In other words, it
      indicates the <strong>minimum cost</strong> at which different quantities of output can be produced when the firm
      is using the best available technique.
    </div>

    <p class="subheading">Short-run and Long-run Cost Functions</p>
    <ul class="points">
      <li>
        In the <strong>short run</strong>, some factors are fixed and some are variable. The short-run cost function
        shows how cost varies with output when plant size is fixed.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the <strong>long run</strong>, all factors are variable. The long-run cost function shows the minimum cost
        associated with each level of output when the firm is free to choose its most efficient plant size.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The cost function is the basis on which various <strong>cost concepts</strong> such as fixed cost, variable cost,
      average cost, marginal cost, etc., are defined and analysed.
    </p>

    <!-- BROAD CLASSIFICATION OF COST CONCEPTS -->
    <p class="section-title">2. Broad Classification of Cost Concepts</p>
    <p>
      For a clear and examiner-friendly answer, cost concepts may be classified under the following heads:
    </p>
    <ol class="points">
      <li><strong>Traditional or General Cost Concepts</strong> (money cost, real cost, opportunity cost, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Accounting and Economic Cost Concepts</strong> (explicit, implicit, accounting, economic cost)</li>
      <li><strong>Short-run Cost Concepts</strong> (TFC, TVC, TC, AFC, AVC, SAC, SMC)</li>
      <li><strong>Long-run Cost Concepts</strong> (LTC, LAC, LMC)</li>
      <li><strong>Social and Private Costs</strong> (where relevant)</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- I. TRADITIONAL / GENERAL COST CONCEPTS -->
    <p class="section-title">3. Traditional / General Concepts of Cost</p>

    <p class="subheading">3.1 Money Cost</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Money cost</strong> (also called <em>nominal cost</em>) refers to the <strong>actual money expenditure</strong>
      incurred by a firm in the production of a commodity. It includes wages, rent, interest, payment for raw materials,
      power, fuel, taxes, etc., all measured in monetary terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the accounting point of view, money cost is what appears in the firm’s books of accounts and profit and loss
      statement.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">3.2 Real Cost</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Real cost</strong> refers to the <strong>sacrifice</strong> involved in terms of efforts and disutility
      of labour and abstinence of capitalists. In older economic literature, it meant the “pain and sacrifice” undergone
      by various factors of production in the process of creating output. In modern usage, the term is rarely used in
      exact measurement, but the idea survives indirectly in opportunity cost.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">3.3 Opportunity Cost</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Opportunity cost</strong> is one of the most important concepts in modern microeconomics.
    </p>
    <div class="boxed">
      <strong>Opportunity Cost:</strong><br>
      The opportunity cost of any resource is the <strong>value of the next best alternative use</strong> that is
      sacrificed when the resource is used in a particular way.
    </div>
    <p>
      For example, if a farmer uses his land to grow wheat instead of sugarcane, the opportunity cost of producing
      wheat is the income forgone from not producing sugarcane. Opportunity cost is the foundation of modern economic
      cost and is particularly relevant in economic decision-making.

    </p>

    <p class="subheading">3.4 Explicit and Implicit Cost</p>
    <ul class="points">
      <li>
        <strong>Explicit Cost:</strong> These are <strong>actual money payments</strong> made by the firm to outsiders
        for hiring factor services and purchasing inputs (wages, rent, interest, raw materials, power, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Implicit Cost:</strong> These are the <strong>imputed costs</strong> of self-owned and self-supplied
        resources for which no direct payment is made. For example, the salary that the owner could earn elsewhere or
        the interest he forgoes on his own capital invested in the business.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="subheading">3.5 Accounting Cost and Economic Cost</p>
    <ul class="points">
      <li>
        <strong>Accounting Cost:</strong> The cost recorded in the books of accounts, consisting mainly of explicit
        money expenses. Accounting profit is calculated as total revenue minus accounting cost.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Economic Cost:</strong> The cost used in economic analysis, consisting of both <strong>explicit and
        implicit costs</strong> (i.e., including opportunity costs). Economic profit = total revenue − economic cost.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="subheading">3.6 Private Cost and Social Cost</p>
    <ul class="points">
      <li>
        <strong>Private Cost:</strong> Costs actually incurred by the firm or individual in production (wages, rent,
        materials, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social Cost:</strong> Private cost plus any <strong>external costs</strong> imposed on society due to
        production, such as pollution, congestion, environmental damage. Social cost is relevant in welfare economics
        and public policy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- II. SHORT-RUN COST CONCEPTS -->
    <p class="section-title">4. Short-run Cost Concepts</p>
    <p>
      In the <strong>short run</strong>, some factors (like plant, machinery, building) are fixed and others (like
      labour, raw materials, power) are variable. Accordingly, short-run cost concepts are defined as follows:
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">4.1 Total Fixed Cost (TFC)</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Total Fixed Cost</strong> is the total cost of employing the fixed factors of production. It does not vary
      with the level of output. Even if output is zero, fixed costs must be incurred.
    </p>
    <p>Examples: rent of factory building, insurance, salaries of permanent staff, interest on fixed capital, etc.</p>
    <p>
      Graphically, the TFC curve is a <strong>horizontal straight line</strong> parallel to the X-axis, indicating that
      fixed cost remains constant at all levels of output.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">4.2 Total Variable Cost (TVC)</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Total Variable Cost</strong> is the total cost of employing variable factors. It varies directly with the
      level of output: if output is zero, TVC is zero; as output increases, TVC increases.
    </p>
    <p>Examples: cost of raw materials, wages of casual labour, power, fuel, etc.</p>

    <p class="subheading">4.3 Total Cost (TC)</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Total Cost</strong> in the short run is the sum of total fixed cost and total variable cost:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:ui-monospace,monospace;background:#f3f7fb;padding:8px 12px;border-radius:6px;display:inline-block;">
      TC = TFC + TVC
    </p>
    <p>
      The TC curve starts from the level of TFC on the cost axis and rises as output increases in the same pattern as
      the TVC curve.
    </p>

    <p class="section-title">5. Average and Marginal Cost Concepts (Short Run)</p>

    <p class="subheading">5.1 Average Fixed Cost (AFC)</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Average Fixed Cost</strong> is the fixed cost per unit of output:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:ui-monospace,monospace;background:#f3f7fb;padding:6px 10px;border-radius:6px;display:inline-block;">
      AFC = TFC / Q
    </p>
    <p>
      As output increases, TFC is spread over more units, so AFC <strong>continuously falls</strong> and approaches zero
      but never becomes zero. The AFC curve is downward sloping and hyperbolic in shape.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">5.2 Average Variable Cost (AVC)</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Average Variable Cost</strong> is the variable cost per unit of output:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:ui-monospace,monospace;background:#f3f7fb;padding:6px 10px;border-radius:6px;display:inline-block;">
      AVC = TVC / Q
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, due to better utilisation of variable factors and increasing returns, AVC falls; after a certain level
      of output, due to diminishing returns to the variable factor, AVC starts rising. Hence the AVC curve is
      <strong>U-shaped</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">5.3 Average Cost (AC) or Average Total Cost (ATC)</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Average Cost</strong> is total cost per unit of output:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:ui-monospace,monospace;background:#f3f7fb;padding:6px 10px;border-radius:6px;display:inline-block;">
      AC = TC / Q = (TFC + TVC) / Q = AFC + AVC
    </p>
    <p>
      The AC curve is also <strong>U-shaped</strong>. At low levels of output, both AFC and AVC fall, causing AC to
      decline. Beyond a certain point, the rise in AVC (due to diminishing returns) dominates the fall in AFC and AC
      begins to rise.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">5.4 Marginal Cost (MC)</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Marginal Cost</strong> is the addition to total cost when one more unit of output is produced:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:ui-monospace,monospace;background:#f3f7fb;padding:6px 10px;border-radius:6px;display:inline-block;">
      MC = ΔTC / ΔQ
    </p>
    <p>
      Since fixed cost does not change with output, marginal cost is also equal to the change in TVC:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:ui-monospace,monospace;background:#f3f7fb;padding:6px 10px;border-radius:6px;display:inline-block;">
      MC = ΔTVC / ΔQ
    </p>
    <p>
      The MC curve is also <strong>U-shaped</strong>, falling initially due to increasing returns and rising later due
      to diminishing returns. MC intersects AVC and AC at their respective minimum points.
    </p>

    <!-- III. LONG-RUN COST CONCEPTS -->
    <p class="section-title">7. Long-run Cost Concepts</p>
    <p>
      In the <strong>long run</strong> all factors of production are variable and the firm can change its plant size.
      The firm has a family of short-run average cost curves corresponding to different plant sizes. Long-run cost
      concepts are defined as:
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">7.1 Long-run Total Cost (LTC)</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Long-run Total Cost</strong> is the minimum cost of producing different levels of output when the firm is
      free to adjust all inputs and choose the most efficient plant. It represents the envelope of various possible
      total cost combinations in the long run.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">7.2 Long-run Average Cost (LAC)</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Long-run Average Cost</strong> is the minimum average cost of producing different levels of output when
      the firm adjusts all factors optimally. It is obtained as:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:ui-monospace,monospace;background:#f3f7fb;padding:6px 10px;border-radius:6px;display:inline-block;">
      LAC = LTC / Q
    </p>
    <p>
      The LAC curve is generally <strong>U-shaped</strong> or <strong>“saucer-shaped”</strong>, falling initially due
      to economies of scale, remaining flat over a range of constant returns to scale, and rising later due to
      diseconomies of scale. It is often described as an <strong>envelope curve</strong> of short-run AC curves.

    <p class="subheading">7.3 Long-run Marginal Cost (LMC)</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Long-run Marginal Cost</strong> is the addition to LTC when one extra unit of output is produced in the
      long run:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:ui-monospace,monospace;background:#f3f7fb;padding:6px 10px;border-radius:6px;display:inline-block;">
      LMC = ΔLTC / ΔQ
    </p>
    <p>
      The LMC curve relates to the LAC curve in the same way as MC relates to AC in the short run: LMC lies below LAC
      when LAC is falling, cuts LAC at its minimum point, and lies above LAC when LAC is rising.

    <!-- IMPORTANCE -->
    <p class="section-title">9. Importance of Cost Function and Cost Concepts</p>
    <p>
      The discussion of cost function and cost concepts is not merely theoretical; it has direct practical relevance:
    </p>

    <div class="importance-box">
      <strong>(a) Basis of Output and Pricing Decisions</strong><br>
      A firm’s decision about how much to produce depends on the relationship between <strong>marginal cost and marginal
      revenue</strong>. Without a clear understanding of MC and AC, the firm cannot correctly determine its equilibrium
      output and price.
    </div>

    <div class="importance-box">
      <strong>(b) Planning of Scale and Plant Size</strong><br>
      Long-run cost concepts (LAC, LMC) help the firm decide the <strong>optimum scale of operations</strong>, plant
      size and level of output at which long-run average cost is minimised.
    </div>

    <div class="importance-box">
      <strong>(c) Cost Control and Cost Reduction</strong><br>
      Distinguishing between fixed and variable costs enables management to identify which items can be controlled in
      the short run and how the cost per unit can be reduced by increasing capacity utilisation.
    </div>

    <div class="importance-box">
      <strong>(d) Policy Formulation</strong><br>
      For public utilities, regulated industries and taxation policy, the government must understand cost structure and
      cost behaviour to frame appropriate pricing and subsidy policies.
    </div>

    <div class="importance-box">
      <strong>(e) Examination Significance</strong><br>
      In Panjab University B.Com (Sem I) examinations, the question “What is cost function? Explain the various concepts
      of cost.” typically carries high marks. A systematic, well-classified answer covering general, short-run and
      long-run cost concepts as above is highly scoring and reflects a sound understanding of the prescribed text of
      T.R. Jain &amp; V.K. Ohri.
    </div>

    <!-- EXAM TIP -->
    <div class="exam-tip">
      <strong>Exam Tip:</strong>
      For a 15-marks answer, first define cost function with C = f(Q) and mention short-run and long-run cost functions.
      Then systematically classify cost concepts: (i) traditional/general (money, real, opportunity, explicit/implicit,
      accounting/economic, private/social); (ii) short-run (TFC, TVC, TC, AFC, AVC, AC, MC) with formulas and U-shaped
      curves; (iii) long-run (LTC, LAC, LMC). Support with a neat short-run cost diagram and finish with the importance
      of cost concepts. This structure is exactly in line with Panjab University expectations.
    </div>

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <p class="section-title">Conclusion</p>
    <p>
      To conclude, a <strong>cost function</strong> captures in a compact form the technological and price conditions
      under which a firm operates by showing the minimum cost of producing different levels of output. On this
      foundation, microeconomics builds a rich set of <strong>cost concepts</strong>—money cost, opportunity cost,
      explicit and implicit cost, accounting and economic cost, fixed and variable cost, total, average and marginal
      costs, and long-run cost measures. Together, these concepts form the analytical backbone of the theory of the
      firm, guiding output, pricing and scale decisions and occupying a core position in the B.Com Semester I
      Microeconomics syllabus of Panjab University.
