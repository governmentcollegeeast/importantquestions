    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <p class="section-title">Introduction</p>
    <p>
      The law of demand tells us that quantity demanded of a commodity varies inversely with its price, 
      <em>ceteris paribus</em>. However, this qualitative statement does not reveal <strong>how much</strong> 
      quantity demanded will change when price changes. For that, economists use the concept of 
      <strong>Price Elasticity of Demand</strong>, and within this concept, they speak of different 
      <strong>degrees</strong> of elasticity. T.R. Jain and V.K. Ohri, in their treatment of microeconomics 
      for B.Com Semester I (Panjab University), lay particular emphasis on these degrees, because they form 
      the basis for interpreting diagrams, numerical problems, and policy discussions relating to demand.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this answer, the meaning of price elasticity of demand is first recalled briefly, and then the main 
      <strong>degrees of price elasticity of demand</strong> are explained in detail, with numerical ranges, 
      conceptual interpretation, simple examples, revenue implications and comparative tabulation.
    </p>

    <!-- MEANING -->
    <p class="section-title">Meaning of Price Elasticity of Demand</p>
    <p>
      Price Elasticity of Demand may be defined as the <strong>degree of responsiveness of quantity demanded 
      of a commodity to a change in its own price</strong>, other factors remaining constant. Symbolically:
    </p>

    <p class="formula">
      E<sub>p</sub> = (Percentage change in Quantity Demanded) ÷ (Percentage change in Price)
    </p>

    <p>
      If a small change in price leads to a relatively large change in quantity demanded, demand is said to be 
      highly elastic. If even a substantial change in price produces only a small change in quantity demanded, 
      demand is described as inelastic. On the basis of this responsiveness, different <strong>degrees of elasticity</strong> 
      are distinguished.
    </p>

    <!-- DIAGRAM OF DEGREES -->
    <p class="section-title">Diagrammatic Overview of Degrees of Elasticity</p>
    <p>
      The different degrees of price elasticity of demand are usually presented with reference to the shapes 
      and slopes of demand curves. In the figure below, the main cases as discussed in standard texts are indicated.

    <!-- MAIN DEGREES -->
    <p class="section-title">Main Degrees of Price Elasticity of Demand</p>
    <p>
      On the basis of numerical value of E<sub>p</sub> and the nature of the demand curve, the following degrees 
      are usually distinguished in undergraduate microeconomics as per TR Jain & V.K. Ohri:
    </p>

    <ol class="points">
      <li>Perfectly Elastic Demand (E = ∞)</li>
      <li>Perfectly Inelastic Demand (E = 0)</li>
      <li>Relatively Elastic Demand (E &gt; 1)</li>
      <li>Relatively Inelastic Demand (E &lt; 1)</li>
      <li>Unitary Elastic Demand (E = 1)</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- 1. PERFECTLY ELASTIC -->
    <p class="section-title">1. Perfectly Elastic Demand (E<sub>p</sub> = ∞)</p>
    <p>
      Demand is said to be <strong>perfectly elastic</strong> when even the smallest possible rise in price reduces 
      the quantity demanded to zero, and the tiniest fall in price leads to an indefinitely large expansion in quantity demanded.
      In this case, elasticity is infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graphically, the demand curve is drawn as a <strong>horizontal straight line</strong> parallel to the X-axis. At a given price, 
      consumers are ready to buy any amount of the commodity, but if price rises even slightly above this level, they refuse to buy at all.
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      <strong>Example:</strong> Highly competitive markets for a perfectly homogeneous commodity with many sellers and buyers, where each seller 
      is a price-taker, are sometimes approximated as having perfectly elastic demand for the individual firm; any attempt to charge a higher 
      price would reduce the firm’s sales to zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfectly elastic demand is largely a theoretical limiting case used to illustrate the upper extreme of elasticity. In real markets, 
      demand may be highly elastic but rarely absolutely infinite.
    </p>

    <!-- 2. PERFECTLY INELASTIC -->
    <p class="section-title">2. Perfectly Inelastic Demand (E<sub>p</sub> = 0)</p>
    <p>
      Demand is <strong>perfectly inelastic</strong> when quantity demanded remains completely unchanged irrespective of any change in price.
      Consumers are compelled to buy a fixed quantity regardless of how high or how low the price may be. In this case, elasticity is zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      The demand curve in this situation is a <strong>vertical straight line</strong> parallel to the Y-axis. Whatever the price, the quantity 
      demanded is fixed and does not respond.
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      <strong>Example:</strong> In extreme theoretical cases, life-saving medicines in the absence of any substitute may be assumed to have 
      perfectly inelastic demand in the very short run. Some amount must be purchased to survive, however high the price may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the previous case, perfectly inelastic demand is a limiting case used for analytical clarity. In reality, some responsiveness 
      almost always exists over a sufficiently long time horizon.
    </p>

    <!-- 3. RELATIVELY ELASTIC -->
    <p class="section-title">3. Relatively Elastic Demand (E<sub>p</sub> &gt; 1)</p>
    <p>
      Demand is said to be <strong>relatively elastic</strong> when the percentage (or proportionate) change in quantity demanded is greater 
      than the percentage change in price. Thus, a small fall in price leads to a more than proportionate increase in quantity demanded; 
      conversely, a small rise in price results in a more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded.
    </p>

    <p class="formula">
      If |ΔQ/Q| &gt; |ΔP/P| &nbsp;⇒&nbsp; |E<sub>p</sub>| &gt; 1 (Relatively elastic)
    </p>

    <p>
      The demand curve in this case is relatively <strong>flatter</strong>, reflecting strong responsiveness. Consumers are sensitive 
      to price because either close substitutes are available or the good occupies a large share in the consumer’s budget.
    </p>

    <p class="example">
      <strong>Example:</strong> Branded goods with plenty of close substitutes (e.g., a particular cold drink in a market with many similar 
      brands) often exhibit relatively elastic demand; a small increase in price is likely to divert consumers to other brands.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the point of view of revenue, when demand is elastic, a fall in price tends to increase total revenue, while a rise in price 
      tends to reduce total revenue.
    </p>

    <!-- 4. RELATIVELY INELASTIC -->
    <p class="section-title">4. Relatively Inelastic Demand (E<sub>p</sub> &lt; 1)</p>
    <p>
      Demand is described as <strong>relatively inelastic</strong> when the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage 
      change in price. In other words, even a significant change in price induces only a modest change in quantity demanded.
    </p>

    <p class="formula">
      If |ΔQ/Q| &lt; |ΔP/P| &nbsp;⇒&nbsp; |E<sub>p</sub>| &lt; 1 (Relatively inelastic)
    </p>

    <p>
      The demand curve in such a case is relatively <strong>steep</strong>. Consumers are not very sensitive to price changes, either because 
      the commodity is a necessity, has very few substitutes, or constitutes a small proportion of their total expenditure.
    </p>

    <p class="example">
      <strong>Example:</strong> Basic necessities such as common salt or matches typically exhibit relatively inelastic demand within normal 
      price ranges. Even if their price rises, consumers do not significantly reduce their consumption, because quantities used are small 
      and substitutes are limited.
    </p>

    <p>
      When demand is inelastic, a rise in price causes total revenue to increase, while a fall in price leads to lower total revenue. This 
      fact is important for indirect tax policy and pricing of essential goods.
    </p>

    <!-- 5. UNITARY ELASTIC -->
    <p class="section-title">5. Unitary Elastic Demand (E<sub>p</sub> = 1)</p>
    <p>
      Demand is <strong>unitary elastic</strong> when the percentage change in quantity demanded is exactly equal to the percentage change 
      in price. Here, the proportionate responsiveness of demand matches the proportionate change in price.
    </p>

    <p class="formula">
      |ΔQ/Q| = |ΔP/P| &nbsp;⇒&nbsp; |E<sub>p</sub>| = 1 (Unitary elastic)
    </p>

    <p>
      The demand curve representing unitary elasticity is usually drawn as a rectangular hyperbola, indicating that total expenditure 
      (or total revenue) remains constant at all points on the curve: a fall in price is exactly offset by a proportionate increase 
      in quantity demanded, and vice versa.
    </p>

    <p class="example">
      <strong>Example:</strong> If a fall in price of 20% leads to a rise in quantity demanded of 20%, the demand for that commodity in that 
      price range is unitary elastic, since total expenditure remains unchanged.
    </p>

    <!-- APPLICATIONS / IMPORTANCE -->
    <p class="section-title">Significance of Knowing Degrees of Elasticity</p>
    <ol class="points">
      <li>
        <strong>Pricing and revenue strategy:</strong> Firms adjust prices differently depending on whether 
        demand for their product is highly elastic, inelastic or unitary. The degree of elasticity guides them 
        in deciding whether a price cut or a price increase will enhance total revenue.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Taxation and public policy:</strong> Governments prefer to tax commodities whose demand is 
        relatively inelastic so that revenue is substantial while quantity and welfare distortions are limited.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Substitute and complement analysis:</strong> Degrees of elasticity help evaluate the closeness 
        of substitutes and the strength of complementarity, which is vital for competition policy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Welfare and incidence:</strong> The incidence and burden of taxes, subsidies and price controls 
        depend on the degree of elasticity of demand vis-à-vis supply.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- EXAM TIP -->
    <div class="exam-tip">
      <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> In a 15-mark answer, begin with a precise definition of elasticity, then 
      systematically explain each degree under clear headings, including numerical value, diagrammatic idea, 
      one real-life example and total revenue implication. Conclude with a short paragraph on the practical 
      significance of knowing whether demand is elastic, inelastic or unitary.
    </div>

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <p class="section-title">Conclusion</p>
    <p>
      To summarise, the concept of price elasticity of demand becomes meaningful and operational only when its 
      various degrees are clearly distinguished and understood. The classification into perfectly elastic, perfectly 
      inelastic, relatively elastic, relatively inelastic and unitary elastic demand allows economists, firms and 
      policymakers to interpret market behaviour in a systematic way. A well-organised examination answer presenting 
      definitions, diagrams, numerical ranges, examples and revenue implications of each degree fully satisfies the 
      expectations of Panjab University examiners and is entirely consistent with the analytical treatment in 
      standard texts such as T.R. Jain and V.K. Ohri.
