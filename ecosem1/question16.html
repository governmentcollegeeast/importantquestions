    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <p class="section-title">Introduction</p>
    <p>
      The <strong>theory of production</strong> studies the relationship between <strong>inputs (factors of production)</strong>
      and <strong>output</strong>. In the <em>short run</em>, some factors (like plant, machinery, land, building etc.)
      are <strong>fixed</strong>, while others (such as labour, raw material, power etc.) are <strong>variable</strong>.
      When output is increased or decreased by changing only the quantity of the variable factor, keeping other factors
      constant, the behaviour of output is explained by the <strong>Law of Variable Proportions</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the PU B.Com Semester I syllabus, following <strong>T.R. Jain &amp; V.K. Ohri, Microeconomics</strong>, the
      law of variable proportions is treated as a <strong>fundamental short-run law of production</strong>. It is also
      known in older literature as the <strong>Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns</strong>.
    </p>

    <!-- MEANING -->
    <p class="section-title">Meaning of Law of Variable Proportions</p>
    <p>
      Suppose land and machinery (capital) are fixed, and the producer varies the units of labour employed. As more and
      more units of labour are applied to a given fixed factor, total output first rises at an increasing rate, then at
      a diminishing rate, and eventually may even start declining. This systematic pattern is summarized in the Law of
      Variable Proportions.
    </p>

    <div class="boxed">
      <strong>Statement of the Law:</strong><br>
      As the quantity of one factor of production is increased, keeping the quantities of other factors fixed, the total
      output at first increases at an <strong>increasing rate</strong>, then increases at a <strong>diminishing rate</strong>,
      and finally <strong>declines</strong>, after a certain point. Correspondingly, the marginal product of the variable
      factor rises, then falls, and ultimately becomes negative.
    </div>

    <p>
      Thus, as the proportion between the variable factor and the fixed factor changes, the productivity behaviour
      passes through <strong>three distinct stages</strong>, which are very important for a producer’s decision-making.
    </p>

    <!-- ASSUMPTIONS -->
    <p class="section-title">Assumptions of the Law of Variable Proportions</p>
    <p>
      The law operates under certain standard assumptions, as presented in your prescribed text:
    </p>
    <ol class="points">
      <li>
        <strong>Short-run situation:</strong> At least <strong>one factor is fixed</strong> (e.g., land, plant size),
        while one factor is variable (e.g., labour). Thus, factor proportions are changeable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Homogeneous units of variable factor:</strong> All units of the variable factor are <strong>identical</strong>
        in quality and efficiency, i.e., one unit of labour is the same as another unit of labour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Constant technology:</strong> The technique of production remains <strong>unchanged</strong>. Any change
        in output is only due to change in factor proportions, not due to improvements in technology.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Divisibility of factors:</strong> The variable factor can be increased or decreased in small units.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Perfect divisibility of product:</strong> Output can be measured and divided into units conveniently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rational behaviour:</strong> The producer is rational and aims at <strong>maximising profit</strong> or
        at least maximising output for a given cost.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Applicable to agriculture and industry:</strong> The law is of general applicability and is not confined
        only to agriculture, although classical economists first discussed it in the context of agriculture.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- SCHEDULE -->
    <p class="section-title">Illustrative Schedule of Total, Average and Marginal Product</p>
    <p>
      The operation of the law can be shown with the help of a hypothetical schedule. Consider land (fixed) and labour
      (variable). As more units of labour are employed on the same land, total product (TP), marginal product (MP) and
      average product (AP) behave as follows:
    </p>

    <table aria-label="Illustrative schedule for law of variable proportions">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Units of Labour<br>(Variable Factor)</th>
          <th>Total Product<br>(TP)</th>
          <th>Marginal Product<br>(MP)</th>
          <th>Average Product<br>(AP = TP/L)</th>
          <th>Stage</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>8.0</td><td>Stage I (Increasing Returns)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td><td>18</td><td>10</td><td>9.0</td><td>Stage I (MP rising, AP rising)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td><td>30</td><td>12</td><td>10.0</td><td>Stage I (TP rising at increasing rate)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td><td>40</td><td>10</td><td>10.0</td><td>End of Stage I (AP at maximum)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5</td><td>48</td><td>8</td><td>9.6</td><td>Stage II (Diminishing Returns)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6</td><td>54</td><td>6</td><td>9.0</td><td>Stage II (MP falling, AP falling)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>7</td><td>56</td><td>2</td><td>8.0</td><td>Stage II (TP increasing at diminishing rate)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>8</td><td>55</td><td>−1</td><td>6.9</td><td>Stage III (Negative Returns; TP falls)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      From the schedule we observe:
    </p>
    <ul class="points">
      <li>TP rises at an <strong>increasing rate</strong> up to 3 units of labour (MP rising).</li>
      <li>TP continues to rise but at a <strong>diminishing rate</strong> from 4th to 7th unit (MP falling but still positive).</li>
      <li>TP reaches a <strong>maximum</strong> at 7 units, and then <strong>declines</strong> when the 8th unit is employed (MP becomes negative).</li>
      <li>AP rises initially, reaches its <strong>maximum</strong>, and then declines.</li>
      <li>MP initially rises, then falls, and ultimately becomes <strong>negative</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- THREE STAGES -->
    <p class="section-title">Three Stages of the Law of Variable Proportions</p>

    <p class="subheading">Stage I – Increasing Returns to the Variable Factor</p>
    <p>
      In Stage I, as the variable factor (labour) is increased:
    </p>
    <ul class="points">
      <li><strong>TP rises at an increasing rate</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>MP rises</strong> and is greater than AP.</li>
      <li><strong>AP rises</strong> and reaches its maximum at the end of Stage I.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This stage starts from the origin where the first unit of labour is employed and continues up to the point where
      <strong>AP is maximum</strong>. Economically, this stage reflects improved utilisation of fixed factors. Initially,
      the fixed factor (e.g., land, machine) is underutilised; as more labour is added, specialisation and better
      division of labour become possible, resulting in increasing returns.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">Stage II – Diminishing Returns to the Variable Factor</p>
    <p>
      In Stage II:
    </p>
    <ul class="points">
      <li><strong>TP continues to increase</strong>, but at a <strong>diminishing rate</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>MP is positive</strong> but <strong>declining</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>AP is also falling</strong>, but remains positive.</li>
      <li>This stage lies between the point where AP is maximum and the point where MP becomes zero.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Stage II is the <strong>economically rational stage of production</strong>. A producer will operate in this region
      because in Stage I, fixed factors are still underutilised, and in Stage III, marginal product becomes negative.
      In Stage II, both factors are utilised in an economically meaningful way and the firm can adjust the optimum
      combination of fixed and variable factors.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">Stage III – Negative Returns to the Variable Factor</p>
    <p>
      In Stage III:
    </p>
    <ul class="points">
      <li><strong>TP declines</strong> with the addition of further units of the variable factor.</li>
      <li><strong>MP becomes negative</strong>.</li>
      <li>AP continues to fall.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This stage begins where MP becomes zero and continues as MP turns negative. Economically, Stage III is an
      <strong>irrational region of production</strong>, because the producer is adding units of variable factor which
      actually <strong>reduce total output</strong>. In a competitive environment, no rational producer will voluntarily
      operate in this stage.
    </p>

    <!-- REASONS OF APPLICABILITY -->
    <p class="section-title">Reasons of Applicability of the Law (Causes of Operation)</p>
    <p>
      The question specifically asks for the <strong>reasons of applicability</strong> of the law of variable proportions.
      That is, why does this pattern of increasing, diminishing and negative returns generally appear in the short run?
      The main reasons, as discussed in T.R. Jain &amp; V.K. Ohri, can be grouped as follows:
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">1. Indivisibility and Better Utilisation of Fixed Factors</p>
    <p>
      Many fixed factors such as machines, land, buildings, management, etc., are <strong>indivisible</strong>. They
      cannot be used in very small fractions. When only a few units of the variable factor are combined with a large
      indivisible fixed factor, that fixed factor remains <strong>underutilised</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As more units of the variable factor are employed, the fixed factor is used more intensively and efficiently.
      Consequently, TP increases at an increasing rate and MP rises, giving <strong>increasing returns</strong> in
      the initial stage. Thus, indivisibility and fuller utilisation of fixed factors explain the existence of <em>Stage I</em>.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">2. Increased Specialisation and Division of Labour</p>
    <p>
      In the beginning, when only a small number of workers are employed, each worker may have to perform many different
      tasks and cannot become highly specialised in any one task. As more workers are added:
    </p>
    <ul class="points">
      <li>Work can be <strong>divided</strong> into smaller tasks.</li>
      <li>Each worker can <strong>specialise</strong> in a particular operation.</li>
      <li>Coordination between workers and fixed equipment improves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This leads to higher efficiency and higher productivity per unit of labour, contributing to the <strong>increasing
      returns</strong> part of the law. After a point, however, the scope for further specialisation is exhausted.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">3. Fixity of at Least One Factor and Crowding of Variable Factor</p>
    <p>
      The essence of the law of variable proportions is that, in the short run, some factors are <strong>fixed</strong>.
      When more and more units of the variable factor are applied to the same fixed factor, a situation of
      <strong>overcrowding</strong> or <strong>over-utilisation</strong> arises.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if too many workers are put to work on the same machine or the same piece of land:
    </p>
    <ul class="points">
      <li>Each worker gets <strong>less fixed capital</strong> or land to work with.</li>
      <li>Workers may get in each other’s way, causing <strong>disruption and inefficiency</strong>.</li>
      <li>Management and supervision become more difficult.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Beyond the optimum proportion, additional units of the variable factor contribute less and less to output,
      leading to <strong>diminishing marginal returns</strong> and, eventually, negative returns. This explains
      <em>Stage II and Stage III</em>.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">4. Imperfect Substitutability of Factors</p>
    <p>
      In real life, factors of production are not <strong>perfect substitutes</strong> for each other. More and more
      units of labour, for instance, cannot indefinitely compensate for a limited amount of land or machinery. Due to
      this imperfect substitutability:
    </p>
    <ul class="points">
      <li>Initially, some substitution between factors is possible, contributing to rising MP.</li>
      <li>Beyond a point, additional labour without additional capital or land cannot be properly absorbed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Hence, as the variable factor is increased while fixed factors remain constant, diminishing and negative returns
      are bound to set in sooner or later. This limited substitutability of factors supports the <strong>universal
      applicability</strong> of the law in the short run.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">5. Optimal Factor Proportion and Economic Rationality</p>
    <p>
      For every given technology, there is an <strong>optimum factor proportion</strong> at which the combination of
      fixed and variable factors yields the best possible productivity. When the firm employs less than this optimum
      amount of the variable factor, fixed factors are underutilised and productivity rises as variable factor is added.
      Once the optimum is reached, any further increase in the variable factor disturbs this optimal balance and
      <strong>reduces efficiency</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, the law of variable proportions reflects the <strong>movement towards and away from this optimum
      factor combination</strong>. It is “applicable” because producers in the real world typically operate with a fixed
      capacity in the short run and must decide how much variable input to add to it.
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">6. Short-run Nature of Production Decisions</p>
    <p>
      In the long run, firms can vary all factors; they can change the size of the plant, acquire more land, or install
      additional machinery. In such a long-run setting, the <strong>Law of Returns to Scale</strong> is more relevant.
      But in the short run, firms necessarily make decisions by varying only some factors while others remain fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because short-run production is a universal feature of economic life, the <strong>law of variable proportions
      becomes widely applicable</strong>. Most real-world production decisions—especially in agriculture, small-scale
      industry and services—show the pattern predicted by this law.
    </p>

    <!-- IMPORTANCE -->
    <p class="section-title">Importance of the Law of Variable Proportions</p>
    <p>
      The applicability of the law is also clear from its practical importance in economics and business:
    </p>

    <div class="importance-box">
      <strong>(a) Basis of Rational Employment of Factors</strong><br>
      The law helps the producer in deciding how many units of the variable factor should be applied to the fixed
      factor. A rational producer will operate only in <strong>Stage II</strong>, where both MP and AP are positive and
      marginal product is declining. Stage I and Stage III are ruled out on grounds of economic rationality.
    </div>

    <div class="importance-box">
      <strong>(b) Foundation of Cost Curves</strong><br>
      The behaviour of MP and AP of the variable factor under the law of variable proportions is closely related to
      the shape of <strong>short-run cost curves</strong> (AVC, ATC and MC). Diminishing marginal returns are a key
      reason why marginal cost eventually rises.
    </div>

    <div class="importance-box">
      <strong>(c) Policy Significance</strong><br>
      In agriculture, the law explains why overcrowding of labour on small holdings or excessive use of fertilisers
      and irrigation may lead to <strong>diminishing and negative returns</strong>, which has implications for land
      reform, consolidation of holdings and adoption of improved techniques.
    </div>

    <div class="importance-box">
      <strong>(d) Theoretical Link between Production and Supply</strong><br>
      The law of variable proportions influences producers’ decisions regarding output in the short run, and hence it
      indirectly affects the <strong>short-run supply curve</strong> of the firm and the industry.
    </div>

    <!-- EXAM TIP -->
    <div class="exam-tip">
      <strong>Exam Tip:</strong>
      For a 15-marks answer in Panjab University on “Law of Variable Proportions along with its reasons of applicability”,
      you should:
      (i) give a precise statement of the law; 
      (ii) write standard assumptions; 
      (iii) present a TP–MP–AP schedule; 
      (iv) draw and neatly label TP, MP and AP curves, clearly marking the three stages; 
      (v) explain each stage separately; 
      (vi) discuss, in a separate heading, the reasons of applicability/causes of operation (indivisibility, specialisation,
      fixity of factors, imperfect substitutability, optimal proportion); and 
      (vii) add a brief note on the importance of the law, followed by a crisp conclusion.
    </div>

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <p class="section-title">Conclusion</p>
    <p>
      To conclude, the <strong>Law of Variable Proportions</strong> is a fundamental short-run law of production. It
      describes how output responds when the quantity of one factor is varied while other factors are kept fixed. Total
      product first increases at an increasing rate, then at a diminishing rate, and ultimately falls, giving rise to
      three distinct stages of production. The law is widely applicable because in the short run at least one factor
      remains fixed, factors are imperfect substitutes, and producers face the problem of choosing an optimum combination
      of fixed and variable inputs. Its careful treatment in your prescribed text by T.R. Jain &amp; V.K. Ohri makes it
      an important, frequently asked question in B.Com Semester I examinations.
