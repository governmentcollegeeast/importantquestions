  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>A <strong>Joint Venture</strong> and a <strong>Partnership</strong> both involve two or more persons working together for mutual gain, but their structure, objective, duration, and legal standing differ significantly. A Joint Venture is a temporary business arrangement undertaken for a specific purpose, whereas Partnership is a long-term continuous relationship governed by the Partnership Act, 1932.</p>
  <p>Understanding these differences is essential for correct legal treatment and accounting presentation.</p>

This answer forms part of a carefully curated set of important questions that have frequently appeared in
past university examinations and therefore hold a high probability of reappearing in future assessments.
While prepared with academic accuracy and aligned to the prescribed syllabus, these solutions should be
treated as high-quality preparation material rather than a guaranteed prediction of any upcoming exam paper.
