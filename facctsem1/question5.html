      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In partnership accounting, it is important to distinguish between <strong>dissolution of partnership</strong> and <strong>dissolution of partnership firm</strong>. Although the terms look similar, they have different legal and accounting implications. Dissolution of partnership refers to a change in the relationship between partners, whereas dissolution of the firm results in the complete closure and winding up of partnership business.</p>

      <h2>Detailed Explanation</h2>
      <p><strong>Dissolution of Partnership</strong> occurs when the existing agreement among partners changes. The business continues, but the firm is said to be reconstituted. This occurs in cases such as admission, retirement, death, insolvency of a partner, or changes in the profit-sharing ratio. Only revaluation adjustments and capital account adjustments are made.</p>

      <p><strong>Dissolution of Partnership Firm</strong> refers to the complete closure of the business. The firm’s books are closed permanently, and a Realisation Account is prepared to transfer assets and liabilities. All liabilities are paid off, and any remaining balance is distributed among partners according to their capital or profit-sharing ratio.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Thus, while the dissolution of partnership merely changes the structure of the firm, dissolution of partnership firm results in complete cessation of business. Understanding this difference is essential for correct accounting treatment and legal compliance in partnership accounts.</p>
