  <h2>Definition of Accounting</h2>
  <p>Accounting may be defined as the <strong>systematic process of identifying, recording, classifying, summarising and communicating financial information</strong> to users for decision-making. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) defines accounting as: "the art of recording, classifying and summarising in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which are, in part at least, of financial character, and interpreting the results thereof."</p>
  <p>Thus, accounting is not merely bookkeeping; it is a complete information system that measures business performance, ensures control and supports planning.</p>

  <h2>Process / Functions of Accounting</h2>
  <p>The accounting process consists of several interconnected stages that convert raw financial data into meaningful information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1. Identifying Transactions:</strong> Determining which business activities are financial in nature and measurable in monetary terms.</li>
    <li><strong>2. Recording (Journalising):</strong> Entering transactions chronologically in the journal using double-entry system.</li>
    <li><strong>3. Classifying (Posting to Ledger):</strong> Transferring journal entries to ledger accounts to group similar transactions together.</li>
    <li><strong>4. Summarising:</strong> Preparing trial balance, trading account, profit & loss account and balance sheet to summarise financial data.</li>
    <li><strong>5. Analysis:</strong> Evaluating profitability, liquidity, solvency and performance through ratios and comparative statements.</li>
    <li><strong>6. Interpretation:</strong> Explaining the results to management, investors and other stakeholders for better decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>7. Communication:</strong> Presenting financial statements and reports to interested parties.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Together, these steps make accounting a complete information and decision-support system.</p>

  <h2>Objectives of Accounting</h2>
  <p>The major objectives of accounting are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1. To Maintain Systematic Records:</strong> Ensures all transactions are recorded properly for future reference.</li>
    <li><strong>2. To Ascertain Profit or Loss:</strong> Through the preparation of Trading and Profit & Loss Account.</li>
    <li><strong>3. To Show Financial Position:</strong> Balance Sheet reflects assets, liabilities and capital at a given date.</li>
    <li><strong>4. To Provide Information for Decision Making:</strong> Helps management in planning, controlling and evaluating business operations.</li>
    <li><strong>5. To Assist in Financial Planning:</strong> Provides data for budgets, forecasts and long-term strategies.</li>
    <li><strong>6. To Protect and Guard Business Assets:</strong> Accounts provide a check on misuse of assets through internal control systems.</li>
    <li><strong>7. To Provide Evidence in Court:</strong> Books of accounts can act as legal proof.</li>
    <li><strong>8. To Meet Legal Requirements:</strong> Compliance with taxation laws, corporate laws and regulatory guidelines.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Advantages of Accounting</h2>
  <p>Accounting offers several benefits that support the functioning and growth of a business:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1. Provides Complete and Systematic Records:</strong> Prevents errors, omissions and confusion.</li>
    <li><strong>2. Facilitates Comparison:</strong> Helps compare results of different periods and with other organisations.</li>
    <li><strong>3. Helps in Decision-Making:</strong> Provides financial insights required for investment, expansion or cost control.</li>
    <li><strong>4. Ensures Control Over Assets:</strong> Detects fraud, leakage or inefficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>5. Helps in Determining Tax Liabilities:</strong> Assists in correct assessment of GST, income tax, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>6. Acts as Legal Evidence:</strong> Proper records serve as documentary proof in disputes.</li>
    <li><strong>7. Facilitates Raising Loans:</strong> Banks rely on audited financial statements to grant credit.</li>
    <li><strong>8. Supports Future Planning:</strong> Helps forecast sales, costs and capital needs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Accounting plays a fundamental role in every business organisation. It not only records transactions but also analyses and interprets financial information for better decision-making. With its structured process, clear objectives and numerous advantages, accounting acts as the backbone of financial management and business control.</p>
