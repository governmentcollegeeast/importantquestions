<h2>Meaning of Adjustments</h2>
<p>Adjustments refer to the essential changes made at the end of an accounting period to bring the accounts to their correct and true financial position. These adjustments ensure that revenues and expenses are recorded in the period to which they actually relate, following the <strong>accrual concept, matching concept, and conservatism principle</strong>.</p>
<p>Adjustments are incorporated into the <strong>Trading Account, Profit & Loss Account, and Balance Sheet</strong> to reflect an accurate picture of profit earned and the financial position of the business.</p>

<h2>Need for Making Adjustments</h2>
