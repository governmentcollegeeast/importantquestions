  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Consignment and Joint Venture are two important forms of business relationships, but they differ completely in their nature, purpose, ownership structure, risk-sharing, and accounting treatment. Understanding the distinction is essential for correctly preparing accounts and identifying the roles of parties involved.</p>
  <p>In a <strong>Consignment</strong>, goods are sent by the consignor to the consignee for the purpose of sale on behalf of the consignor, while in a <strong>Joint Venture</strong>, two or more persons join together for a specific business venture and share profits and losses.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Consignment and Joint Venture differ fundamentally in purpose, ownership, risk, and accounting. Consignment is a continuing Principal–Agent arrangement, whereas Joint Venture is a temporary partnership for a specific project. Understanding these distinctions is essential for accurate accounting treatment in commercial transactions.</p>
