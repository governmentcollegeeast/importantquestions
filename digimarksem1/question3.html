<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Digital marketing covers a wide range of techniques and platforms that help businesses connect with their target audience online. As consumer behaviour shifts towards mobile usage, social networks, search engines and digital content, understanding various types of digital marketing has become essential. Each type has unique advantages, objectives and tools that allow marketers to design effective strategies for brand growth.</p>

<h2>1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>
<p>SEO refers to the process of improving the visibility and ranking of a website on organic (non-paid) search engine results pages. It includes on-page optimization (keywords, meta tags, content quality), off-page optimization (backlinks, social signals) and technical SEO (speed, mobile friendliness). Higher ranking brings more traffic and credibility.</p>

<h2>2. Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</h2>
<p>SEM involves paid advertising on search engines, mainly through Google Ads. Businesses bid on keywords so their ads appear at the top of search results. It offers fast visibility, measurable performance and precise targeting.</p>

<h2>3. Social Media Marketing (SMM)</h2>
<p>SMM includes promoting products through platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat. Activities include content creation, paid ads, contests, customer engagement and influencer collaboration. It helps build brand awareness and community engagement.</p>

<h2>4. Content Marketing</h2>
<p>This focuses on creating valuable content in forms such as blogs, videos, reels, e-books, infographics, podcasts and newsletters. The aim is to educate, engage and convert potential customers. Content marketing builds trust and supports SEO strategy.</p>

<h2>5. Email Marketing</h2>
<p>Email marketing involves sending promotional messages, newsletters, offers and reminders to a targeted audience. It supports customer retention, relationship building and remarketing. Automation tools allow personalized email sequences.</p>

<h2>6. Affiliate Marketing</h2>
<p>In affiliate marketing, businesses partner with affiliates who promote their products and earn commission for every sale, lead or click generated. It reduces risk for businesses since payment is based on performance.</p>

<h2>7. Influencer Marketing</h2>
<p>Brands collaborate with influencers who have a strong following on social media. Influencers promote products through reels, stories, videos and reviews. This creates trust-based marketing and reaches a highly engaged audience.</p>

<h2>8. Mobile Marketing</h2>
<p>Mobile marketing includes SMS campaigns, WhatsApp promotions, app-based ads, push notifications and mobile-optimized content. As mobile usage increases, this type of marketing becomes essential for conversions.</p>

<h2>9. Video Marketing</h2>
<p>Video marketing uses platforms like YouTube, Instagram Reels, Facebook and TikTok to promote products through tutorials, testimonials, ads, short clips and brand stories. Video content improves engagement and retention.</p>

<h2>10. Display Advertising</h2>
<p>Display ads include banner ads, pop-ups, sidebar ads and retargeting ads on websites and apps. They help in brand visibility and remind users of products they have shown interest in.</p>

<h2>11. Online Reputation Management (ORM)</h2>
<p>ORM involves maintaining a positive brand image online by responding to reviews, addressing complaints, monitoring online mentions and managing feedback platforms. It helps build customer trust.</p>

<h2>12. E-Commerce Marketing</h2>
<p>E-commerce marketing involves promoting online shops through sponsored product listings, discounts, SEO, influencer promotions and retargeting ads. It is widely used by Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho and D2C brands.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Digital marketing encompasses diverse techniques that work together to enhance a brand's online presence, attract potential customers and drive business growth. Each type of digital marketing contributes uniquely to visibility, engagement and conversions. Understanding these types helps businesses choose the most effective combination for achieving their goals.</p>
