    </p>

    <article>
      <p>
        <strong>Introduction.</strong> In recent decades, one environmental term has entered everyday conversation,
        policy debates and scientific reports more than any other – <strong>global warming</strong>. It refers to the
        gradual increase in the Earth’s average surface temperature, mainly due to human activities that enhance the
        natural greenhouse effect. Global warming is not an isolated phenomenon; it is intimately linked with
        <strong>climate change</strong>, sea-level rise, melting of glaciers, extreme weather events and a range of
        ecological and social impacts. Therefore, a clear understanding of its definition, causes and consequences is
        essential for every student of Environmental Studies.
      </p>

      <h2>Meaning and definition of global warming</h2>
      <p>
        The Earth has always experienced small natural fluctuations in temperature. However, global warming refers to a
        relatively <strong>rapid, human-induced warming trend</strong> observed especially since the Industrial
        Revolution.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Definition (exam-oriented):</strong></p>
      <p style="margin-left:16px;">
        <em>“Global warming is the long-term increase in the average temperature of the Earth’s surface and lower
        atmosphere, primarily due to the rising concentrations of greenhouse gases released by human activities such as
        burning fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial processes.”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        In simple words, global warming means that the planet as a whole is becoming <strong>warmer than before</strong>,
        not just for a few days or a season, but over decades and centuries.
      </p>

      <h2>Conceptual background: link with greenhouse effect and climate change</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Certain gases in the atmosphere – <strong>carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), ozone,
          water vapour and some industrial gases</strong> – trap part of the heat radiated by the Earth. This natural
          <strong>greenhouse effect</strong> keeps the planet warm enough for life.
        </li>
        <li>
          When human activities increase the concentration of these greenhouse gases, the greenhouse effect becomes
          <strong>stronger</strong>, trapping more heat. This intensified greenhouse effect is the immediate physical
          cause of global warming.
        </li>
        <li>
          Global warming, in turn, is a major driver of broader <strong>climate change</strong>, influencing rainfall
          patterns, frequency of extreme events, sea-level and many other aspects of the climate system.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Major causes of global warming</h2>
      <p>
        While some natural factors influence Earth’s temperature, the present phase of global warming is dominated by
        <strong>anthropogenic (human-induced)</strong> causes. These are largely connected with modern patterns of
        energy use, land-use change and economic development.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Burning of fossil fuels for energy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The most important cause is the extensive use of <strong>coal, petroleum and natural gas</strong> for
          electricity generation, transport, industry and household energy needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          When these fuels burn, they release large quantities of <strong>carbon dioxide (CO₂)</strong> into the
          atmosphere.
        </li>
        <li>
          CO₂ is the single largest contributor to the enhanced greenhouse effect because it is released in very large
          amounts and remains in the atmosphere for a long time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Deforestation and land-use changes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Forests act as major <strong>carbon sinks</strong>. Trees absorb CO₂ during photosynthesis and store carbon
          in their biomass and in the soil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Large-scale <strong>cutting and burning of forests</strong> for agriculture, urbanisation, roads and other
          development projects releases the stored carbon back into the atmosphere as CO₂.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the same time, the removal of forests reduces the planet’s capacity to absorb future emissions – a
          “double blow” that accelerates global warming.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Agriculture and livestock-related emissions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Methane (CH₄)</strong>, a greenhouse gas much more powerful than CO₂ per molecule, is released from
          <strong>paddy fields, wetlands, ruminant animals (cattle, sheep, goats), manure storage and landfills</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nitrous oxide (N₂O)</strong> is emitted from soils when excessive amounts of nitrogenous fertilisers
          are used and from some industrial processes.
        </li>
        <li>
          These gases, though present in smaller quantities than CO₂, have a high <strong>global warming potential</strong>
          and substantially contribute to global warming.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Industrial processes and synthetic greenhouse gases</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Certain industries release greenhouse gases as by-products. For example, <strong>cement manufacturing</strong>
          releases CO₂, and some chemical processes release N₂O and other gases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Human beings have also created entirely <strong>synthetic greenhouse gases</strong> such as CFCs, HCFCs and
          HFCs used in refrigeration, air-conditioning, aerosol sprays and foam blowing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Although present in small concentrations, these gases are very efficient at trapping heat and thus contribute
          significantly to warming.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Urbanisation, transport growth and lifestyle patterns</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Rapid growth of cities has led to increased demand for <strong>transport, electricity, cement, steel and
          consumer goods</strong>, all of which are energy-intensive and based largely on fossil fuels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modern lifestyles often encourage high levels of consumption and waste – frequent use of private vehicles,
          air-conditioners, energy-intensive appliances and “use-and-throw” products – all of which indirectly raise
          greenhouse gas emissions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cities also generate <strong>urban heat islands</strong>, where local temperatures are higher due to
          concrete surfaces, lack of vegetation and waste heat from human activities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Poor waste management</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Open dumps and landfills</strong> containing organic wastes produce methane under anaerobic
          conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Burning of solid waste, agricultural residues and biomass adds CO₂ and black carbon to the atmosphere.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All these human activities together have significantly increased the concentrations of greenhouse gases since
        pre-industrial times, leading to a measurable rise in global average temperatures – the phenomenon we call
        global warming.
      </p>

      <h2>Potential impacts of global warming on the environment</h2>
      <p>
        Global warming does not have a single, uniform impact. It affects various components of the Earth’s
        environment—including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and biosphere—in complex and interrelated ways.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Rising global temperatures and heat waves</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The most direct impact is the <strong>increase in average surface temperature</strong> of the Earth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many regions are experiencing more frequent and intense <strong>heat waves</strong>, which can damage crops,
          stress animals and affect human health.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Melting of glaciers, ice caps and polar ice</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Higher temperatures cause <strong>glaciers in mountain ranges</strong> (e.g., Himalayas) and
          <strong>polar ice sheets</strong> in Greenland and Antarctica to melt at accelerated rates.
        </li>
        <li>
          The melting of glaciers threatens the long-term water supply of rivers that depend on glacial melt, affecting
          both ecosystems and human populations downstream.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Sea-level rise</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Global warming leads to <strong>thermal expansion of seawater</strong> (water expands as it warms) and
          melting of land-based ice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Both processes contribute to <strong>rising sea levels</strong>, which can inundate low-lying coastal areas,
          erode shorelines, increase salinity in estuaries and threaten small island states.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Changes in rainfall patterns and hydrological cycle</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to changes in <strong>rainfall distribution</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some regions are likely to experience more frequent <strong>intense rainfall and floods</strong>, while
          others may face longer <strong>droughts and water scarcity</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes in monsoon behaviour can seriously affect agriculture, groundwater recharge and freshwater
          availability.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Increased frequency of extreme weather events</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Global warming is associated with more frequent and intense <strong>cyclones, storms, heavy rainfall events,
          wildfires and heat waves</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          These disasters cause severe damage to ecosystems, infrastructure and human settlements.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Many plants and animals have specific temperature and moisture requirements. Rapid warming can exceed their
          ability to <strong>adapt, migrate or evolve</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coral reefs are particularly vulnerable; higher temperatures cause <strong>coral bleaching</strong> and
          eventual death of corals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shifts in the distribution of species, changes in migration patterns, altered timing of flowering and
          breeding, and possible <strong>extinction of sensitive species</strong> are expected outcomes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Ocean acidification (indirect but related)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A portion of the CO₂ emitted into the atmosphere dissolves in seawater, forming carbonic acid and causing
          <strong>ocean acidification</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          This affects marine organisms, particularly those that build shells or skeletons from calcium carbonate, and
          can disrupt entire marine food webs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Potential impacts of global warming on human life</h2>
      <p>
        The environmental changes described above translate into serious impacts on <strong>health, food security,
        water resources, livelihoods and social stability</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Impacts on human health</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          More frequent and intense <strong>heat waves</strong> increase the risk of heat stroke, dehydration and
          cardiovascular problems, especially among the elderly, children and outdoor workers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns influence the spread of <strong>vector-borne diseases</strong>
          such as malaria, dengue and chikungunya, as mosquitoes expand into new areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Floods and extreme weather events may increase <strong>water-borne diseases</strong> and contamination of
          drinking water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Malnutrition and related health problems may rise if crop yields decline due to climate stress.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Impacts on agriculture and food security</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Global warming can alter the length and quality of the growing season, affect flowering and pollination, and
          change the incidence of pests and diseases.
        </li>
        <li>
          In some cooler regions, moderate warming may temporarily increase yields, but in many tropical and
          subtropical regions, higher temperatures and irregular rainfall are likely to <strong>reduce crop
          productivity</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          This threatens <strong>food security</strong>, raises food prices and may lead to social unrest in vulnerable
          communities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Impacts on water resources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Changing rainfall patterns and melting glaciers affect the quantity and timing of river flows.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some regions may experience <strong>increased flooding</strong>, while others suffer from <strong>chronic
          water shortages</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Competition for water between agriculture, industry and domestic use can lead to conflicts and stress.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Displacement, migration and social conflicts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sea-level rise, recurrent floods, droughts and desertification may force people to migrate from affected
          areas, creating <strong>environmental or climate refugees</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sudden migration puts pressure on cities and other regions, potentially leading to <strong>conflicts over
          land, water and jobs</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Economic losses and development challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Damage to infrastructure from storms and floods, reduced agricultural productivity, health costs and
          adaptation measures impose a heavy <strong>economic burden</strong> on countries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developing countries, which have contributed least to global warming, are often the most vulnerable and have
          fewer resources to adapt, raising issues of <strong>climate justice and equity</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exam-oriented recap (ideal structure for 15 marks)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Begin with a short introduction linking global warming with greenhouse effect and climate change.</li>
        <li>Give a clear, textbook-style definition of global warming in 2–3 lines.</li>
        <li>Explain briefly how global warming is related to the <strong>enhanced greenhouse effect</strong>.</li>
        <li>List and explain major causes: fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture & livestock, industry & synthetic gases, urbanisation and waste.</li>
        <li>Under a separate heading, discuss potential impacts on the <strong>environment</strong>: temperature rise, glaciers and sea-level, rainfall and extremes, ecosystems and biodiversity, oceans.</li>
        <li>Then, discuss impacts on <strong>human life</strong>: health, agriculture and food security, water resources, displacement/migration and economic losses.</li>
        <li>End with a balanced conclusion emphasising that global warming is human-induced but can be controlled through collective action and sustainable development.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> To sum up, global warming is the long-term increase in the Earth’s average
        temperature mainly due to human activities that strengthen the greenhouse effect. Its major causes include the
        burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, intensive agriculture, industrial processes, urbanisation and poor
        waste management. The potential impacts are far-reaching: disturbance of climate patterns, melting of ice and
        sea-level rise, damage to ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as serious risks to human health, food and water
        security, livelihoods and economic development. Understanding global warming is therefore not just an academic
        requirement but a practical necessity for planning sustainable futures and taking responsible individual and
        collective action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
