    <article>
      <p>
        <strong>Introduction.</strong> Water is rightly described as the “elixir of life”. All organisms – plants,
        animals and human beings – depend on water for survival, growth and reproduction. Rivers, lakes, ponds,
        wetlands, groundwater and oceans together constitute the earth’s hydrosphere and perform vital ecological,
        economic and social functions. However, rapid industrialisation, urbanisation, population growth and intensive
        agriculture have severely degraded the quality of many water bodies. When water is contaminated beyond its
        natural self-purifying capacity, the condition is known as <strong>water pollution</strong>. It poses a serious
        threat to aquatic ecosystems, human health and sustainable development.
      </p>

      <h2>Meaning and definition of water pollution</h2>
      <p>
        In simple terms, water pollution means “making water dirty or unsafe for use” by adding unwanted materials.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Definition (exam-oriented):</strong></p>
      <p style="margin-left:16px;">
        <em>“Water pollution is any undesirable change in the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of water,
        caused directly or indirectly by human activities, which makes it unfit for drinking, domestic use, agriculture,
        industry, recreation or for supporting aquatic life.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The substances that cause water pollution are called <strong>water pollutants</strong>. They may be in the form
        of <strong>organic matter, inorganic salts, toxic chemicals, heavy metals, nutrients, sediments, pathogens,
        oil, plastics</strong>, etc.
      </p>

      <h2>Major causes of water pollution</h2>
      <p>
        Causes can be conveniently grouped into <strong>domestic, industrial, agricultural and other sources</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In many towns and cities, large quantities of <strong>municipal sewage</strong> (wastewater from toilets,
          bathrooms, kitchens and other household activities) are discharged into nearby rivers, drains and lakes
          without adequate treatment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sewage contains <strong>organic matter, suspended solids, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and disease-causing
          microorganisms</strong> such as bacteria, viruses and protozoa.
        </li>
        <li>
          This is one of the <strong>most important causes</strong> of water pollution in developing countries.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Industrial effluents</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Industrial units such as <strong>tanneries, textile mills, paper mills, sugar factories, chemical industries,
          fertiliser plants, refineries and pharmaceutical industries</strong> discharge effluents into nearby surface
          water bodies or on land.
        </li>
        <li>
          These effluents may contain <strong>acids, alkalis, dyes, organic chemicals, heavy metals (mercury, lead,
          cadmium, chromium), oils, toxic compounds and high temperatures</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          When not properly treated, they cause severe local pollution and sometimes long-term contamination of rivers
          and groundwater.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Agricultural runoff and agro-chemicals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Modern agriculture makes intensive use of <strong>chemical fertilisers, pesticides, weedicides and
          insecticides</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          During rains or irrigation, part of these chemicals is washed from fields into canals, ponds, rivers and
          reservoirs as <strong>agricultural runoff</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Excess fertilisers add large amounts of <strong>nitrate and phosphate</strong>, leading to eutrophication,
          while pesticides persist and accumulate in the food chain.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Solid waste dumping and plastic pollution</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In many areas, <strong>municipal solid waste</strong> and construction debris are dumped near or directly
          into water bodies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Plastics, polythene bags, bottles, packaging material and microplastics</strong> float on the surface
          or sink to the bottom, harming aquatic life and spoiling aesthetics.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leachate from open dumps and landfills contaminates nearby surface water and groundwater.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Oil spills and shipping activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Leakage during <strong>transport, storage and refining of petroleum</strong> causes oil spills in rivers and
          seas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Oil forms a thin film on the water surface, reducing oxygen transfer and affecting marine plants and animals.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Mining, quarrying and other land-based activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mining operations generate <strong>acid mine drainage</strong> and wash-off of heavy metals and sediments into
          rivers and streams.
        </li>
        <li>
          Soil erosion from deforested or poorly managed lands increases the <strong>sediment load</strong> in water,
          making it turbid and silted.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Thermal and radioactive discharges (special causes)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Thermal power plants</strong> and some industries discharge hot water into rivers, raising the
          temperature of the receiving water body (thermal pollution).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Radioactive wastes</strong> from nuclear power plants, research facilities or medical use, if not
          properly handled, can contaminate water with radioactive isotopes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Effects of water pollution on aquatic life</h2>
      <p>
        Aquatic ecosystems are very sensitive to changes in water quality. Major impacts include:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Decrease in dissolved oxygen (DO)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sewage and organic wastes provide food for bacteria. As bacteria decompose this organic matter, they consume
          large amounts of <strong>dissolved oxygen</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Low DO levels (<strong>oxygen depletion</strong>) lead to the death of fishes and other aerobic organisms,
          resulting in fish kills and foul odour.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Eutrophication and algal blooms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Excessive nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) from fertilisers and sewage cause <strong>rapid growth of algae
          and aquatic plants</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          When these algae die and decompose, they further deplete oxygen, making the water body <strong>eutrophic</strong>,
          i.e., over-enriched but biologically degraded.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some algae may produce toxins (harmful algal blooms), affecting fish, birds and even humans consuming such
          water.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Toxicity to aquatic organisms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Heavy metals (mercury, lead, cadmium), cyanides, acids, alkalis and industrial chemicals are directly
          <strong>toxic</strong> to fish, plankton, molluscs and other aquatic organisms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many of these pollutants are persistent and cause <strong>bioaccumulation</strong> (build-up in the body) and
          <strong>biomagnification</strong> (increase along the food chain) affecting top predators such as birds, fish
          eaters and even humans.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Destruction of habitat and biodiversity loss</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sedimentation fills ponds, lakes and river beds, destroying spawning grounds, nesting sites and habitat
          diversity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sensitive species (certain fishes, amphibians, aquatic insects, corals) may decline or disappear, reducing
          overall <strong>biodiversity</strong> and destabilising food webs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Thermal and radioactive effects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A rise in water temperature due to hot effluents lowers oxygen solubility and can stress or kill cold-loving
          species.
        </li>
        <li>
          Radioactive contamination may interfere with reproduction, cause mutations and long-term ecological damage.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Effects of water pollution on human communities</h2>
      <p>
        Human societies depend on water for drinking, domestic use, agriculture, fisheries, industry and recreation.
        Pollution of water resources directly affects all these uses.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Short-term and long-term health impacts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Water-borne diseases:</strong> Consumption of water contaminated with pathogens leads to diarrhoea,
          cholera, typhoid, dysentery, hepatitis and other gastrointestinal illnesses, especially among children and
          the poor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chemical-related health problems:</strong> Long-term exposure to polluted water containing heavy
          metals, arsenic, fluoride, nitrates and pesticides can cause <strong>cancers, kidney damage, neurological
          disorders, fluorosis and blue-baby syndrome</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Impact on livelihoods and economy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Polluted rivers and lakes reduce fish catches, affecting the livelihoods of <strong>fisherfolk and dependent
          communities</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contaminated irrigation water affects crop yield and quality; agricultural products may carry residues that
          are unsafe for consumers and reduce market value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tourism and recreational activities (boating, bathing, pilgrimage) decline when water bodies are visibly
          polluted and foul-smelling.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Social and equity dimensions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Poor and marginal communities often live near polluted rivers, drains or industrial areas and are
          <strong>disproportionately exposed</strong> to contaminated water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Women and children may have to travel longer distances to fetch safe drinking water when local sources are
          polluted, increasing their burden.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Environmental consequences beyond health</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Degradation of wetlands and rivers reduces their ability to perform ecosystem services such as <strong>flood
          control, groundwater recharge, nutrient cycling and climate regulation</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Aesthetic value of landscapes declines when water bodies are filled with waste, scum and foul odour, reducing
          quality of life in the surrounding area.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Strategies for prevention and control of water pollution</h2>
      <p>
        Effective control of water pollution requires a combination of <strong>technical, legal, economic and social
        measures</strong>. For examination purposes, it is helpful to organise the answer under clear headings.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Sewage treatment and sanitation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Establish and properly operate <strong>sewage treatment plants (STPs)</strong> so that domestic wastewater is
          treated before discharge.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extend <strong>safe sanitation facilities</strong> (toilets, septic tanks, sewerage) to all households to
          prevent open defecation and direct contamination of water sources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Promote small-scale, decentralised treatment systems (oxidation ponds, constructed wetlands, biogas plants)
          in peri-urban and rural areas.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Industrial effluent treatment and regulation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make it legally mandatory for all industries to install and operate <strong>Effluent Treatment Plants
          (ETPs)</strong> and comply with discharge standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage adoption of <strong>cleaner production technologies</strong>, reuse of treated water within the
          industry and zero-liquid-discharge systems wherever feasible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) for clusters of small industries that cannot afford individual
          treatment facilities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Control of agricultural pollution</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Promote <strong>judicious use of fertilisers and pesticides</strong> based on soil testing and actual crop
          needs; encourage organic manures and biofertilisers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use <strong>integrated pest management (IPM)</strong> techniques to reduce reliance on chemical pesticides.
        </li>
        <li>
          Develop and popularise alternatives to crop-residue burning, such as in-situ incorporation, mulching, use in
          biomass power plants and composting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintain vegetative buffer strips along canals and rivers to trap sediments and nutrients before they enter
          water bodies.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Solid waste management and plastic control</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implement scientific <strong>solid waste management</strong>: segregation at source, recycling, composting
          biodegradable waste and sanitary landfilling of rejects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strictly prohibit dumping of waste into water bodies and drains; enforce penalties for violators.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce use of single-use plastics, promote cloth/jute bags and encourage plastic waste collection and
          recycling.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Protection, restoration and monitoring of water bodies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Demarcate and protect the <strong>catchment areas, floodplains and wetlands</strong> associated with rivers
          and lakes from encroachment, construction and sand mining.
        </li>
        <li>
          Undertake programmes for <strong>desiltation, de-weeding and ecological restoration</strong> of polluted
          water bodies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Establish regular <strong>water-quality monitoring</strong> networks and publicly share data to increase
          transparency and awareness.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Legal and policy measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Effective implementation of laws such as the <strong>Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act</strong>
          and provisions under the <strong>Environment (Protection) Act</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use of the <strong>“polluter pays” principle</strong>, environmental compensation, and incentives for
          pollution control measures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inclusion of water-quality considerations in environmental impact assessment (EIA) for all major development
          projects.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Public awareness and community participation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Environmental education</strong> in schools, colleges and communities to make people aware of the
          causes and consequences of water pollution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Involving local communities, NGOs, youth clubs and resident welfare associations in protecting neighbourhood
          ponds, lakes and rivers through clean-up drives and monitoring.
        </li>
        <li>
          Promoting a culture of <strong>water conservation and responsible use</strong>: avoiding wastage, not
          throwing waste into drains, adopting eco-friendly products and supporting “river rejuvenation” initiatives.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exam-oriented recap (how to write this answer in 15 marks)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Begin with a brief introduction on the importance of water and a clear definition of water pollution.</li>
        <li>List major causes under neat headings: sewage, industrial effluents, agriculture, solid waste, oil spills, mining, thermal and radioactive sources.</li>
        <li>Explain effects separately on <strong>aquatic life</strong> (DO, eutrophication, toxicity, biodiversity loss) and on <strong>human communities</strong> (diseases, livelihoods, social issues).</li>
        <li>Discuss consequences of contaminated water on health and environment with 5–6 strong points.</li>
        <li>Provide well-organised prevention and control strategies: sewage and effluent treatment, agricultural control, solid waste management, protection of water bodies, legal measures and public awareness.</li>
        <li>End with a value-based conclusion linking clean water with human right to health and sustainable development.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> To conclude, water pollution is the undesirable alteration of water quality by
        human activities, which makes it unfit for use and harmful to aquatic life. Its major causes include untreated
        sewage, industrial effluents, agricultural runoff, solid waste dumping and various specialised pollutants. The
        consequences are serious – degradation of aquatic ecosystems, loss of biodiversity, spread of water-borne
        diseases, damage to livelihoods and long-term environmental harm. However, with appropriate technical measures,
        strict enforcement of laws, better planning of sewage and industrial treatment, responsible agricultural
        practices and active participation of citizens, water pollution can be prevented and controlled. Protecting our
        rivers, lakes and groundwater is not only an environmental necessity but also a moral and constitutional duty
        towards present and future generations.
