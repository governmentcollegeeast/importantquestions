    <article>
      <p>
        <strong>Introduction.</strong> Land is one of the most fundamental natural resources available to mankind. 
        It provides space for agriculture, forests, settlements, industries, transport networks and all other human 
        activities. At the same time, land forms the physical base on which natural ecosystems such as forests, 
        grasslands, wetlands and deserts exist. In Environmental Studies, <strong>land resources</strong> are treated as 
        a critical component of the life-support system because their misuse and degradation directly affect 
        ecological balance, agricultural productivity and overall quality of life.
      </p>

      <h2>Meaning and definition of land resources</h2>
      <p>
        In simple terms, <strong>land resources</strong> refer to the total area of the earth’s solid surface available 
        for human use and natural ecosystems, along with its physical, chemical and biological attributes.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
      <p style="margin-left:16px;">
        <em>“Land resources are the natural endowments of the earth’s terrestrial surface, including soil, rocks, 
        topography and associated vegetation, which support human activities such as agriculture, forestry, settlements 
        and industry, as well as natural ecosystems and wildlife habitats.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, land resources include not only the flat agricultural fields but also hills, plateaus, valleys, coastal 
        areas, wetlands and other landscapes which together form the physical basis for both human and natural systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Role of land resources in supporting human activities</h2>
      <p>
        Land resources are indispensable for almost every aspect of human life and development. Their role can be 
        discussed under the following heads:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Base for agriculture and food production</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Land provides the <strong>space and soil medium</strong> necessary for cultivation of crops, horticulture, 
          plantations, pastures and fodder fields.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>quality, depth, slope and fertility</strong> of land directly influence agricultural productivity, 
          cropping patterns and choice of farming systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a country like India, where a large proportion of the population depends on agriculture for livelihood, 
          the health of land resources is directly linked to <strong>food security and rural employment</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Space for human settlements and infrastructure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Land is required for building <strong>villages, towns, cities and industrial estates</strong>. Housing, schools, 
          hospitals and markets all occupy land.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roads, railways, airports, ports, canals and other transport infrastructure use vast stretches of land and 
          influence patterns of development.
        </li>
        <li>
          The manner in which land is used for settlement and infrastructure has long-term implications for 
          <strong>resource availability, environmental quality and disaster risk</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Source of minerals, construction material and other resources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Land contains <strong>mineral deposits</strong> such as coal, iron ore, limestone, bauxite and other 
          economically valuable materials, which are extracted through mining and quarrying.
        </li>
        <li>
          It provides <strong>construction materials</strong> like sand, gravel, clay and stone, which are needed for 
          building houses, roads and dams.
        </li>
        <li>
          Land resources therefore form the base for industrial development and physical infrastructure.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Socio-economic and cultural functions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Land ownership and access to land are central to <strong>social status, economic security and political power</strong> 
          in many societies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Land is associated with cultural and religious values, sacred groves, burial grounds and historical sites.
        </li>
        <li>
          Patterns of land use reflect broader socio-economic structures and development priorities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Role of land resources in supporting natural ecosystems</h2>
      <p>
        Land resources are equally important for the functioning of natural ecosystems and overall ecological balance:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Habitat and support for vegetation and wildlife</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Forests, grasslands, scrublands, wetlands and deserts are all <strong>terrestrial ecosystems</strong> that 
          depend on the nature of land – its soil type, slope, altitude and moisture conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Different landforms and soils support different kinds of vegetation, which in turn provide habitat for 
          diverse wildlife species.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Regulation of hydrological cycle</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Land, through its soil cover and vegetation, controls <strong>infiltration, runoff and groundwater recharge</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Healthy land surfaces with good vegetative cover allow rainwater to percolate, reduce flooding and maintain 
          stream flow during dry periods.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Maintenance of ecological processes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Land resources are involved in <strong>nutrient cycling</strong>, organic matter decomposition and formation of 
          soil profiles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Land cover (forests, grasslands, croplands) influences <strong>local and regional climate</strong>, albedo 
          (reflectivity) and energy balance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Biodiversity conservation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Special land areas such as <strong>biodiversity hotspots, wildlife corridors, wetlands and coastal zones</strong> 
          are crucial for the survival of threatened species.
        </li>
        <li>
          Conservation of land resources is therefore closely linked to the conservation of biodiversity at genetic, 
          species and ecosystem levels.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key factors contributing to degradation of land resources</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Land degradation</strong> refers to a decline in the quality, productivity and ecological value of land 
        due to natural processes and, more importantly, human activities. Major factors responsible are:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Deforestation and removal of vegetative cover</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Large-scale clearing of forests for agriculture, logging, mining and development projects exposes the land 
          surface to erosion by wind and water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Loss of tree cover leads to <strong>soil erosion, landslides, decline in soil fertility and disruption of 
          water regimes</strong>, especially in hilly and watershed areas.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Unsustainable agricultural practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Continuous cropping without adequate rest or rotation, overuse of chemical fertilisers, pesticides and 
          irrigation leads to <strong>nutrient depletion, soil structure damage and salinisation</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cultivation on steep slopes without contouring or terracing accelerates erosion and formation of gullies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Over-extraction of groundwater for irrigation can cause <strong>land subsidence</strong> and drying of wells.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Overgrazing and mismanagement of rangelands</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When the number of grazing animals exceeds the carrying capacity of the land, vegetation is removed faster 
          than it can regenerate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Overgrazing leads to <strong>bare patches, compaction of soil, reduction in infiltration and increased 
          erosion</strong>, ultimately contributing to desertification in dry regions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Urbanisation and industrialisation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Rapid growth of cities converts fertile agricultural land and wetlands into <strong>built-up areas</strong> 
          (buildings, roads, parking lots).
        </li>
        <li>
          Industrial activities and improper waste disposal contaminate land with <strong>hazardous chemicals, heavy 
          metals and solid waste</strong>, making it unsuitable for agriculture or habitation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Mining and quarrying</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Open-cast mining removes topsoil and vegetation, leaving behind spoil heaps and pits which are highly 
          vulnerable to erosion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Quarrying for stone, sand and other materials deteriorates land quality and often disrupts local hydrology.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Desertification and salinisation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In arid and semi-arid areas, overuse of land, deforestation and climate variability can cause 
          <strong>desertification</strong> – the transformation of productive land into desert-like conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Improper irrigation practices and poor drainage lead to <strong>salinisation and waterlogging</strong>, which 
          make land unproductive.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Natural hazards and climate-related factors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Floods, cyclones, landslides, earthquakes and sea-level rise can damage land, erode soil and contaminate 
          agricultural fields with sand or salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Climate change may intensify droughts and extreme rainfall events, aggravating land degradation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Measures for sustainable use and conservation of land resources</h2>
      <p>
        Sustainable use of land resources means meeting present needs while maintaining the land’s productivity, 
        ecological functions and potential for future generations. Important measures include:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Scientific land-use planning and zoning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Land should be used according to its <strong>capability and suitability</strong>. Fragile areas like steep 
          slopes, flood plains and coastal zones should not be used for intensive cultivation or construction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Land-use zoning</strong> can demarcate areas for agriculture, forestry, industry, housing and 
          conservation, reducing conflicts and misuse.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Soil and water conservation measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adoption of <strong>contour ploughing, terracing, bunding, check dams and gully plugging</strong> reduces 
          erosion and improves moisture retention.
        </li>
        <li>
          Watershed management programmes integrate soil and water conservation, afforestation and sustainable 
          agriculture at the level of entire catchments.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Afforestation, reforestation and agroforestry</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Planting trees on degraded lands, wastelands and along field boundaries helps stabilise soil, improve 
          microclimate and enhance biodiversity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Agroforestry systems</strong> (combining trees with crops and/or livestock) provide multiple 
          products and protect land from wind and water erosion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Sustainable agricultural practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Crop rotation, mixed cropping and inclusion of legumes</strong> maintain soil fertility and structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use of <strong>organic manures, compost and green manuring</strong> increases organic matter and supports 
          soil biota.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Integrated nutrient management</strong> and careful use of fertilisers and pesticides prevent 
          chemical degradation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Efficient irrigation methods (drip, sprinkler) and proper drainage reduce waterlogging and salinity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Control of overgrazing and restoration of rangelands</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implementing <strong>controlled and rotational grazing</strong> prevents overuse and allows vegetation to 
          regenerate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Degraded rangelands can be restored by reseeding grasses, planting shrubs and providing watering points 
          and shade.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Environmentally sound mining and rehabilitation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mining operations should include proper <strong>topsoil conservation, slope stabilisation and post-mining 
          land rehabilitation</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Abandoned mines and quarries can be converted into forests, pastures, water bodies or recreational areas 
          through planned reclamation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Legal, policy and institutional measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Enforcement of laws related to land-use, forest conservation, mining and environmental protection is 
          essential to prevent illegal encroachments and degradation.
        </li>
        <li>
          National and state-level policies should promote <strong>equitable access to land, prevention of 
          fragmentation, and protection of common property resources</strong> such as village commons and grazing lands.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8. Public awareness and community participation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Land conservation programmes are most successful when local communities, panchayats, NGOs and 
          self-help groups are actively involved in planning and implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Environmental education</strong> at school, college and community level can change attitudes 
          towards land and promote responsible land-use practices.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exam-oriented recap (points to write)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Define land resources clearly as the terrestrial surface supporting human activities and natural ecosystems.</li>
        <li>Explain their role for humans: agriculture, settlements, infrastructure, minerals and socio-economic functions.</li>
        <li>Explain their role for ecosystems: habitat, hydrological cycle, ecological processes and biodiversity.</li>
        <li>List key causes of degradation: deforestation, unsustainable agriculture, overgrazing, urbanisation, mining, desertification, salinisation and natural hazards.</li>
        <li>Describe conservation measures under clear headings: land-use planning, soil and water conservation, afforestation and agroforestry, sustainable agriculture, controlled grazing, rehabilitation of mined areas, legal measures and community participation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> In conclusion, land resources are the fundamental base on which both human 
        civilisation and natural ecosystems rest. Their misuse and degradation threaten food security, biodiversity, 
        water resources and the very stability of our environment. Therefore, it is essential to understand the true 
        value of land, identify the factors responsible for its degradation and adopt a comprehensive set of measures 
        for its sustainable use and conservation. Only then can we ensure that land resources remain productive and 
        life-supporting for present as well as future generations.
