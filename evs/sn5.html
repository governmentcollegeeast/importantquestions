    <article>
      <p>
        <strong>Introduction.</strong> Every living organism ultimately dies, and dead bodies of plants and animals,
        fallen leaves, dung and other organic remains continuously accumulate in nature. If these materials were not
        broken down, the earth would be buried under dead organic matter, and essential nutrients would get locked
        up in unusable form. The group of organisms which perform the vital function of breaking down such dead
        organic matter are called <strong>decomposers</strong>. They form an indispensable link in all ecosystems.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition of decomposers</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Decomposers</strong> are microscopic or small organisms, mainly <strong>bacteria and fungi</strong>,
        which obtain their food by breaking down the complex organic substances present in dead plants, dead animals
        and other organic wastes into simpler, inorganic substances such as carbon dioxide, water and mineral salts.
        In doing so, they <em>decompose</em> organic matter and release nutrients back into the environment.
      </p>

      <h2>Major groups of decomposers</h2>
      <p>In most terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, important decomposers include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Bacteria:</strong> Numerous species of bacteria act as powerful decomposers. They are especially
          active in the final stages of decomposition and in anaerobic conditions (e.g., deeper soil layers, sediments).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fungi:</strong> Many fungi (such as moulds and mushrooms) possess enzymes capable of breaking down
          tough and complex substances like cellulose and lignin present in wood and plant cell walls. They are very
          important in forest ecosystems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Actinomycetes:</strong> These are a special group of filamentous bacteria that decompose resistant
          organic materials and give soil its characteristic earthy smell.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In some books, small animals like earthworms, termites and certain insects which feed on dead organic matter
        are called <strong>detritivores</strong> or <strong>scavengers</strong>. They help in breaking the material
        into smaller pieces and increase its surface area for action by true decomposers (bacteria and fungi).
      </p>

      <h2>Role of decomposers in ecosystem functioning</h2>
      <p>
        Decomposers occupy the final trophic level in the <strong>food chain</strong> and play multiple crucial roles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Nutrient recycling:</strong> By converting complex organic matter into simple inorganic nutrients,
          decomposers return essential elements like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, etc. to the soil and
          water. These nutrients are again absorbed by plants, thereby completing the <em>biogeochemical cycles</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintenance of soil fertility:</strong> Decomposition enriches the soil with humus and mineral
          nutrients, improves soil structure and enhances its water-holding capacity. This maintains long-term
          productivity of agricultural and forest soils.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cleaning of the environment:</strong> Decomposers help in natural disposal of dead bodies, leaf litter,
          animal excreta and other organic wastes. Without them, the environment would become extremely unhygienic and
          disease-prone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Energy flow:</strong> During decomposition, the organic energy stored in dead organisms is gradually
          released as heat and a part is utilised by decomposers for their own life processes. Thus, they help in
          completing the flow of energy through the ecosystem.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Importance in human-managed systems</h2>
      <p>
        In agriculture and solid waste management, decomposers are deliberately used to our advantage. In
        <strong>composting</strong> and <strong>vermicomposting</strong>, bacteria and fungi decompose organic waste to
        produce good quality manure. In sewage treatment plants, microbial decomposers break down organic pollutants.
        Therefore, understanding the role of decomposers is practically important for sustainable agriculture and
        environmental sanitation.
      </p>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> To conclude, <strong>decomposers</strong> are microscopic organisms, mainly
        bacteria and fungi, which break down dead organic matter and organic wastes into simpler substances. They
        ensure recycling of nutrients, maintain soil fertility, clean the environment and complete the energy flow in
        ecosystems. Without decomposers, life on earth could not continue in a balanced and sustainable manner.

      This answer forms part of a carefully curated set of important questions that have frequently appeared in
      past university examinations and therefore hold a high probability of reappearing in future assessments.
      While prepared with academic accuracy and aligned to the prescribed syllabus, these solutions should be
      treated as high-quality preparation material rather than a guaranteed prediction of any upcoming exam paper.
