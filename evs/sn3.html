      Short Note (c). The decibel level is the threshold above which noise exposure can cause permanent hearing damage.
      <span style="color:var(--muted);">(Concept of threshold level of noise for hearing damage)</span>
    </p>

    <article>
      <p>
        <strong>Introduction.</strong> Noise is generally defined as <em>unwanted, unpleasant or disturbing sound</em>. 
        The intensity or loudness of sound is measured in <strong>decibels (dB)</strong>, on a logarithmic scale. 
        Our ears can tolerate only a limited range of sound intensity. Prolonged exposure beyond a certain decibel level 
        does not merely cause annoyance or discomfort; it can produce <strong>permanent damage to the hearing mechanism</strong> 
        inside the ear.
      </p>

      <h2>Meaning of decibel level and threshold</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>decibel (dB)</strong> is a unit used to express the intensity of sound. Because it is a logarithmic scale, 
        an increase of 10 dB represents roughly a tenfold increase in sound intensity and a much greater increase in 
        perceived loudness. For normal conversation, the sound level is about 50–60 dB, while heavy traffic may produce 
        about 80–90 dB.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term <strong>“threshold level”</strong> refers to the sound intensity above which <em>irreversible or permanent 
        hearing loss</em> may begin to occur if exposure is sufficiently long or frequent. For occupational and environmental 
        health purposes, a level of about <strong>85 dB(A)</strong> is commonly regarded as the critical threshold for 
        long-term exposure.
      </p>

      <h2>Noise level for permanent hearing damage</h2>
      <p>
        Research studies and health standards indicate that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Continuous exposure to noise levels of about <strong>85 dB(A) or more</strong> for 8 hours a day, over several years, 
          can cause <strong>Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL)</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          At levels of <strong>100 dB(A) and above</strong>, even shorter exposures can be harmful; the safe exposure time 
          decreases as the noise level increases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sound levels around <strong>120–130 dB</strong> are often described as the <em>“threshold of pain”</em> and may cause 
          immediate damage to delicate structures in the inner ear.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Initially, a person may experience <strong>temporary threshold shift</strong> (a temporary reduction in hearing 
        sensitivity) after exposure to loud music, machines or explosions. However, repeated or continuous exposure above the 
        threshold level eventually leads to <strong>permanent threshold shift</strong>, that is, permanent hearing impairment.
      </p>

      <h2>Examples of common noise levels</h2>
      <p>To understand the risk, some approximate examples are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quiet room: about 30–40 dB</li>
        <li>Normal conversation: about 50–60 dB</li>
        <li>Busy traffic / noisy classroom: about 70–80 dB</li>
        <li>Heavy trucks, workshops, some factories: 85–95 dB</li>
        <li>Rock concerts, firecrackers, loudspeakers at close range: above 100 dB</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Thus, workers in industries, traffic police personnel, people living near airports, railway lines or busy roads and 
        youth regularly exposed to loud music are at greater risk of crossing the safe threshold level.
      </p>

      <h2>Health implications and need for control</h2>
      <p>
        Once hearing loss becomes permanent, it cannot be easily reversed by medicines or surgery. It leads to difficulties in 
        communication, social isolation, reduced work efficiency and psychological stress. Therefore, Environmental Studies 
        stresses that <strong>noise levels must be kept below the threshold level</strong> by proper urban planning, use of 
        silencers, green belts, strict enforcement of noise standards and by promoting personal protection measures such as ear 
        plugs or ear muffs for workers in noisy occupations.
      </p>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The statement means that there is a critical decibel level (about <strong>85 dB(A)</strong> 
        for prolonged exposure), beyond which noise is not just irritating but becomes dangerous for the ear. Continuous or 
        repeated exposure above this threshold can result in <strong>permanent hearing damage</strong>, making it essential to 
        monitor, regulate and control noise pollution in our environment.

      This answer forms part of a carefully curated set of important questions that have frequently appeared in
      past university examinations and therefore hold a high probability of reappearing in future assessments.
      While prepared with academic accuracy and aligned to the prescribed syllabus, these solutions should be
      treated as high-quality preparation material rather than a guaranteed prediction of any upcoming exam paper.
