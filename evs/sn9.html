      Short Note (i). Food web.

    </p>

    <article>
      <p>
        <strong>Introduction.</strong> In every ecosystem, organisms are linked to one another through feeding
        relationships. Green plants prepare food by photosynthesis, herbivores feed on plants, and carnivores
        feed on herbivores or other carnivores. At first sight, these relationships may look like simple
        straight chains. However, in reality, <strong>each organism may have several different food sources
        and several different predators</strong>. This complex network of interlinked food chains is called a
        <strong>food web</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Meaning and definition of food web</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>food web</strong> may be defined as:
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:16px;">
        <em>“A network of inter-connected food chains in which one organism may occupy different trophic levels
        and may have more than one food or more than one predator in the same ecosystem.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, a food web represents the <strong>actual feeding relationships</strong> in a community,
        and not just the simplified, linear sequence shown in a single food chain.
      </p>

      <h2>Food chain versus food web</h2>
      <p>For a clear understanding, it is useful to compare the two:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Food chain:</strong> A single, straight sequence of “who eats whom”, e.g. Grass → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake → Eagle.</li>
        <li><strong>Food web:</strong> A <em>network</em> formed when many such food chains are interlinked. The same grasshopper may be eaten by a frog or by a bird; the snake may feed on rats as well as frogs, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hence, a food chain is a simplified and idealised representation, while a food web is <strong>more realistic</strong>
        and shows the multiple feeding options available in nature.
      </p>

      <h2>Structure and examples of a food web</h2>
      <p>
        A food web always starts with <strong>producers (green plants, phytoplankton)</strong>, which occupy the first
        trophic level. They are eaten by different herbivores (deer, rabbit, grasshopper, zooplankton, etc.), which form
        the second trophic level. These herbivores are, in turn, eaten by a variety of carnivores like snakes, lizards,
        birds, fishes, etc., forming higher trophic levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in a <strong>grassland ecosystem</strong>, grass may be eaten by rabbit, grasshopper or deer.
        The grasshopper may be eaten by a frog or a bird; the rabbit may be eaten by a fox; the frog may be eaten by a snake;
        and both fox and snake may be eaten by an eagle. When all these overlapping food chains are drawn together, they form
        a complex food web.
      </p>

      <h2>Ecological significance of food webs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Stability of ecosystem:</strong> Because each organism has more than one food option, the food web
          provides <strong>alternative pathways</strong> for energy flow. If one species declines, predators can switch
          to another prey. This makes the ecosystem more stable and less vulnerable to disturbances.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Better utilisation of energy:</strong> Food webs ensure that energy and matter are utilised efficiently,
          as different organisms exploit different components of the same resource base.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintenance of biodiversity:</strong> A rich and complex food web is usually associated with high
          biodiversity. The disappearance of one species may affect several links and therefore the entire web.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Indicator of ecosystem health:</strong> Simple, broken or disturbed food webs generally indicate
          polluted or degraded ecosystems, whereas elaborate food webs reflect a healthy, balanced environment.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exam-oriented recap</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Food web is a network of connected food chains operating in an ecosystem.</li>
        <li>It shows that one organism may have multiple food sources and multiple predators.</li>
        <li>More realistic than a single food chain; represents actual feeding relationships.</li>
        <li>Provides stability, alternative pathways for energy flow and helps maintain biodiversity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> A <strong>food web</strong> is the complex network of interlinked food chains
        through which energy and nutrients flow in an ecosystem. It reflects the high degree of interdependence among
        organisms and contributes to the overall stability and resilience of ecological communities.

      This answer forms part of a carefully curated set of important questions that have frequently appeared in
      past university examinations and therefore hold a high probability of reappearing in future assessments.
      While prepared with academic accuracy and aligned to the prescribed syllabus, these solutions should be
      treated as high-quality preparation material rather than a guaranteed prediction of any upcoming exam paper.
