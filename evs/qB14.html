      <p>
        <strong>Introduction.</strong> Environmental problems such as biodiversity loss, pollution, land degradation
        and industrial accidents cannot be controlled by voluntary efforts alone. They require a strong
        <strong>legal framework</strong>. In India, Parliament has enacted several major environmental laws to give
        effect to constitutional duties and international commitments. Among these, the <strong>Biological Diversity
        Act, 2002</strong> and the <strong>Environment (Protection) Act, 1986</strong> occupy a central place. The
        first deals specifically with conservation and fair use of biological resources and associated knowledge, while
        the second functions as an <em>umbrella legislation</em> for protection and improvement of the environment as a
        whole.
      </p>

      <!-- (a) Biological Diversity Act, 2002 -->
      <span class="sub-label">a. The Biological Diversity Act, 2002</span>

      <h2>1. Background and need</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          India is recognised as one of the world’s <strong>mega-diverse countries</strong>, with rich biodiversity in
          forests, wetlands, mountains, coastal and marine ecosystems.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the same time, biodiversity is under threat from <strong>habitat loss, over-exploitation, invasive
          species, pollution and climate change</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the international level, the <strong>Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)</strong> was adopted at the
          Rio Earth Summit (1992), with three objectives: conservation, sustainable use and fair and equitable
          benefit-sharing from genetic resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          To fulfil its obligations under the CBD and to regulate access to its biological resources and associated
          traditional knowledge, India enacted the <strong>Biological Diversity Act, 2002</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Objectives of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002</h2>
      <p>
        The Act translates the CBD’s three pillars into the Indian context. Its main objectives are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conservation</strong> of biological diversity at genetic, species and ecosystem levels.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sustainable use</strong> of biological resources so that present needs are met without destroying
          options for future generations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fair and equitable sharing of benefits</strong> arising out of the use of India’s biological
          resources and associated traditional knowledge, especially with local and indigenous communities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Institutional framework under the Act</h2>
      <p>
        The Act creates a three-tier structure for biodiversity governance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>National Biodiversity Authority (NBA):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Located at the national level and headquartered at Chennai.</li>
            <li>
              Regulates access by <strong>foreign individuals, companies or organisations</strong> to India’s
              biological resources and associated knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advises the Central Government on conservation, use and benefit-sharing policies, and supports State
              Boards.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>State Biodiversity Boards (SBBs):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Set up by each State Government.</li>
            <li>
              Regulate access to biological resources for <strong>Indian citizens, companies and organisations</strong>
              within the state.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advise the state on matters relating to conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Established at the level of <strong>local bodies</strong> (Panchayats, Municipalities, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
              Responsible for preparing <strong>People’s Biodiversity Registers (PBRs)</strong> documenting local
              biological resources and traditional knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
              Play a crucial role in ensuring benefit-sharing with local communities.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Regulation of access to biological resources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Prior approval of NBA:</strong> Any foreign person, company or non-resident Indian who wishes to
          obtain biological resources from India, or associated knowledge, for research, commercial utilisation, or
          bio-survey and bio-utilisation, must obtain prior approval from the NBA.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Intimation/approval of SBB:</strong> Indian citizens and companies must give prior intimation or
          seek approval from the respective State Biodiversity Board for commercial use of biological resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transfer of research results:</strong> Transfer of research results relating to Indian biological
          resources to foreign entities also requires approval of the NBA.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs):</strong> No IPR (such as patents) based on research or
          information on biological resources obtained from India can be applied for without prior approval of the NBA.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Benefit-sharing provisions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Act emphasises <strong>fair and equitable sharing of benefits</strong> arising from the use of biological
          resources and associated knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
          Benefit-sharing may be in the form of <strong>monetary compensation, joint ventures, technology transfer,
          association of local people in research</strong> or other mutually agreed terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          A portion of the benefits is directed to <strong>Biodiversity Funds</strong> at national, state and local
          levels, which are used for conservation and socio-economic development of local communities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Protection of traditional knowledge and community rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Act recognises the role of <strong>local and indigenous communities</strong> in conserving biodiversity
          and maintaining traditional knowledge about medicinal plants, agriculture, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          It seeks to prevent <strong>“biopiracy”</strong>—the unauthorised use of traditional knowledge and genetic
          resources by foreign companies or individuals without consent or benefit-sharing.
        </li>
        <li>
          People’s Biodiversity Registers help in <strong>recording and protecting</strong> such knowledge at the local
          level.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Offences and penalties</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Violations of the Act, such as access without approval, misrepresentation, or non-compliance with
          benefit-sharing conditions, are treated as <strong>criminal offences</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Punishments include imprisonment and fines, reflecting the seriousness of biodiversity-related crimes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Significance of the Act</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Gives a <strong>legal basis</strong> for conserving India’s biological wealth and regulating its use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Protects <strong>sovereign rights</strong> over biodiversity while fulfilling international obligations
          under CBD.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides a framework for <strong>benefit-sharing</strong> and recognition of local communities and their
          knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourages sustainable, science-based and equity-oriented use of biological resources.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- (b) Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 -->
      <span class="sub-label">b. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986</span>

      <h2>1. Background and rationale</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Before 1986, India already had sector-specific laws such as the <strong>Water (Prevention and Control of
          Pollution) Act, 1974</strong> and the <strong>Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          However, there was a need for a comprehensive law to deal with the environment as a whole and to implement
          decisions taken at the <strong>Stockholm Conference on Human Environment, 1972</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The tragic <strong>Bhopal gas disaster (1984)</strong>, which highlighted gaps in existing safety and
          environmental regulations, further accelerated the demand for a strong, umbrella legislation.
        </li>
        <li>
          In this background, Parliament enacted the <strong>Environment (Protection) Act, 1986</strong>, often called
          the <strong>EPA, 1986</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Aim and scope of the Act</h2>
      <p>
        The long title of the Act states that it is “an Act to provide for the <strong>protection and improvement of
        the environment</strong> and for matters connected therewith.”
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Act gives very <strong>wide powers</strong> to the Central Government to take measures for protecting and
          improving the quality of the environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          It covers all components of the environment—air, water and land—and the relationships among them, making it
          an <strong>umbrella legislation</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Definition of “environment” under the Act</h2>
      <p>
        The Act defines <strong>environment</strong> in a very broad manner to include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>“Water, air and land and the inter-relationship which exists among and between water, air and land, and
          human beings, other living creatures, plants, micro-organisms and property.”</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This comprehensive definition reflects the <strong>ecosystem approach</strong>, seeing environment as a
        connected whole rather than separate pieces.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Powers of the Central Government</h2>
      <p>
        Section 3 of the Act empowers the Central Government to take all necessary measures for protecting and
        improving the environment. Important powers include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Coordinating actions of state governments, authorities and agencies working on environmental protection.
        </li>
        <li>
          Planning and executing programmes for the <strong>prevention, control and abatement of environmental
          pollution</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Laying down <strong>standards for the quality of air, water and soil</strong>, as well as standards for
          emissions and discharges of environmental pollutants from industries, operations and processes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Restricting areas in which certain industries, operations or processes shall not be carried out or shall be
          carried out subject to safeguards (for example, ecologically sensitive areas).
        </li>
        <li>
          Laying down procedures and safeguards for:
          <ul>
            <li>Handling of hazardous substances,</li>
            <li>Prevention of accidents which may cause environmental pollution, and</li>
            <li>Providing for remedial measures in case such accidents occur.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Rule-making and delegated legislation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Act authorises the Central Government to make <strong>rules and notifications</strong> to give effect to
          its provisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many important rules and notifications—such as those relating to <strong>Environmental Impact Assessment
          (EIA), coastal regulation zones, hazardous waste management, plastic waste, biomedical waste, noise
          standards</strong>, etc.—have been issued under the EPA.
        </li>
        <li>
          This flexibility allows the law to respond to new challenges and scientific knowledge without passing a new
          Act every time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Powers of entry, inspection and directions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Act authorises government officers to <strong>enter, inspect and sample</strong> any premises, examine
          records and enforce compliance.
        </li>
        <li>
          It also empowers the Central Government to issue <strong>directions in writing</strong> to any person,
          officer or authority—including orders to close, regulate or prohibit any industry, operation or process, or
          to stop or regulate supply of electricity, water or other services.
        </li>
        <li>
          These powers make the Act a potent tool for enforcing environmental standards.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Offences and penalties</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Contravention of provisions of the Act, rules or orders is punishable with <strong>imprisonment and
          fine</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          For continuing offences, an additional fine per day may be imposed, and in serious cases, extended
          imprisonment terms are possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the offence is committed by a company, persons in charge (directors, managers) can also be held
          responsible under certain conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Significance of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Provides a <strong>comprehensive, overarching legal framework</strong> for environmental protection in India.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enables the Central Government to respond quickly to emerging environmental problems, industrial accidents
          and pollution threats.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serves as the legal basis for many specific rules and notifications (such as EIA, hazardous waste, plastic
          waste), making it central to environmental governance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reflects India’s commitment to its <strong>constitutional duty</strong> (Article 48A and 51A(g)) and
          international environmental obligations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exam-oriented recap (how to write this answer)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Start with a short <strong>introduction</strong> on the need for environmental legislation and mention that
          these two Acts address biodiversity and overall environmental protection.

      </ul>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> In conclusion, the <strong>Biological Diversity Act, 2002</strong> and the
        <strong>Environment (Protection) Act, 1986</strong> together form a vital part of India’s environmental law
        framework. The Biological Diversity Act operationalises the goals of conservation, sustainable use and
        equitable benefit-sharing of our rich biological resources, giving due recognition to local communities and
        their knowledge. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, on the other hand, acts as an umbrella legislation
