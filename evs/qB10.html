      <p>
        <strong>Introduction.</strong> With industrialisation and rapid growth of cities, complaints of dying forests,
        fishless lakes, damaged crops and blackened monuments became common in many parts of the world. Scientists
        traced one important cause to a form of pollution known as <strong>acid rain</strong>. Although rainwater is
        naturally slightly acidic, emissions from factories, power plants and vehicles have made it much more acidic in
        many regions. Acid rain therefore represents a link between <strong>air pollution and damage to land and water
        resources</strong>, and is an important topic in Environmental Studies.
      </p>

      <h2>I. Meaning and definition of acid rain</h2>
      <p>
        Pure water has a pH of 7 (neutral). Natural rainwater, due to the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide forming
        weak carbonic acid, has a pH of about 5.6 and is mildly acidic. When the acidity increases beyond this level
        because of pollution, we call it acid rain.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Definition (exam-oriented):</strong></p>
      <p style="margin-left:16px;">
        <em>“Acid rain is the term used for all forms of precipitation—rain, snow, fog, dew or drizzle—having a pH
        lower than 5.6, mainly due to the presence of strong mineral acids such as sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄) and nitric
        acid (HNO₃) formed from atmospheric pollutants.”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The term “acid deposition” is sometimes used in a broader sense to include both
        <strong>wet deposition</strong> (acid rain, snow, fog) and <strong>dry deposition</strong> (acidic gases and
        particles settling on surfaces).
      </p>

      <h2>II. Chemical process of formation of acid rain</h2>
      <p>
        Acid rain is mainly the result of chemical transformation of certain air pollutants released by human
        activities. The key steps are:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Emission of primary pollutants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, diesel) in <strong>thermal power plants, industries and motor vehicles</strong>
          releases large quantities of <strong>sulphur dioxide (SO₂)</strong> and <strong>nitrogen oxides (NO and NO₂,
          collectively called NOx)</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          These gases are the main <strong>precursors</strong> of acid rain.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Oxidation and conversion into acids</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the presence of <strong>sunlight, oxygen and moisture</strong>, SO₂ and NOx undergo a series of
          photochemical and oxidation reactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          SO₂ is oxidised to sulphur trioxide (SO₃), which then combines with water vapour to form
          <strong>sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄)</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Similarly, NO and NO₂ are oxidised to nitric acid (HNO₃).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Incorporation into clouds and precipitation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The acids formed—mainly H₂SO₄ and HNO₃—are absorbed by cloud droplets or form tiny aerosol particles.
        </li>
        <li>
          When it rains, snows or even when there is fog or drizzle, these acidic components are brought down to the
          Earth’s surface as <strong>acidic precipitation</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Thus, acid rain is an <strong>indirect effect</strong> of air pollution: gases released from a source (often far
        away) are chemically transformed in the atmosphere and later deposited as acids over large areas.
      </p>

      <h2>III. Major causes and sources of acid rain</h2>
      <p>
        For exam purposes, it is useful to classify the causes into <strong>industrial, energy-related, transport and
        other sources</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Thermal power plants and heavy industries</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Coal-based thermal power plants are among the <strong>largest emitters of SO₂</strong>, since coal often
          contains significant amounts of sulphur.
        </li>
        <li>
          Industries such as <strong>oil refineries, smelters, metal processing units, paper and pulp mills, chemical
          fertiliser and acid plants</strong> also release sulphur and nitrogen oxides.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Automobile exhausts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Petrol and diesel vehicles emit substantial amounts of <strong>NOx</strong>, especially in congested urban
          areas with heavy traffic.
        </li>
        <li>
          High-temperature combustion in engines favours the formation of NO and NO₂, which later form nitric acid in
          the atmosphere.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Domestic fuel use and small industries</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use of coal and oil in <strong>households, small industries, brick kilns and boilers</strong> contributes
          additional SO₂ and NOx to the atmosphere.
        </li>
        <li>
          Open burning of waste and low-quality fuels in slums and unorganised sectors further adds to the problem.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Long-range transport of pollutants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A special feature of acid rain is that the area receiving acidic deposition may be far away from the original
          source of pollution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pollutants can be transported by winds across <strong>national boundaries</strong>, making acid rain an
          international problem that requires <strong>cooperative solutions</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>IV. Effects of acid rain</h2>
      <p>
        Acid rain has multiple adverse effects on <strong>soil, water, vegetation, buildings, materials and human
        health</strong>. For a 15-mark answer, each category should be covered separately.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Effects on soil and terrestrial ecosystems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Acid rain increases the <strong>acidity of soil (lowers pH)</strong>, especially in regions where the soil
          has low buffering capacity.
        </li>
        <li>
          It leaches away essential plant nutrients such as <strong>calcium, magnesium and potassium</strong> from the
          soil.
        </li>
        <li>
          It mobilises toxic metals like <strong>aluminium (Al³⁺)</strong>, which can damage plant roots and reduce
          water and nutrient uptake.
        </li>
        <li>
          Over time, these changes weaken trees and crops, making them more susceptible to disease, pests, extreme
          weather and drought.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Effects on water bodies and aquatic life</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When acid rain falls on land, it can run off into lakes, rivers and streams, lowering the <strong>pH of
          surface waters</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many aquatic organisms—fish, insects, plankton and amphibians—are sensitive to pH changes and cannot survive
          in highly acidic conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Acidification reduces biodiversity in lakes; some become <strong>“dead lakes”</strong> with very little
          aquatic life.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mobilised metals such as aluminium are toxic to fish gills and can cause suffocation and death.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Effects on forests and vegetation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In mountainous regions, acid clouds and fog can directly affect leaves and needles of trees, causing
          <strong>yellowing, browning and premature leaf fall</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combined soil and foliar effects lead to <strong>decline of forest health</strong>, observed as thinning of
          forest canopies and slow tree growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some famous forest decline episodes in Europe and North America have been linked closely with acid
          deposition.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Effects on buildings, monuments and materials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Acid rain reacts with <strong>calcium carbonate (marble, limestone)</strong> and other building materials,
          causing erosion and loss of surface details.
        </li>
        <li>
          Historic monuments, statues and heritage structures made of marble and limestone are particularly vulnerable
          (for example, famous temples, forts and memorials).
        </li>
        <li>
          Metals, paints and coatings are corroded faster in areas with high acid deposition, increasing maintenance and
          replacement costs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Effects on human health (indirect)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Acid rain itself does not usually cause acute health effects when falling on the skin, but the <strong>air
          pollutants that cause acid rain</strong> (SO₂, NOx, fine particulates) are harmful when inhaled.
        </li>
        <li>
          These pollutants can cause <strong>respiratory problems, asthma, bronchitis and other lung diseases</strong>,
          especially in sensitive groups such as children and the elderly.
        </li>
        <li>
          By damaging crops, forests and water supplies, acid rain also indirectly affects <strong>food security and
          quality of life</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>V. Control measures and strategies to reduce acid rain</h2>
      <p>
        Because acid rain originates from air pollutants, control measures must focus on reducing emissions of SO₂ and
        NOx and improving energy and industrial practices.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Cleaner fuels and energy choices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Shift from high-sulphur coal and oil to <strong>low-sulphur fuels, natural gas and renewable energy
          sources</strong> such as solar, wind and hydropower.
        </li>
        <li>
          Promote energy efficiency in power generation, industry, transport and households to reduce overall fuel
          consumption.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Emission control technologies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Install <strong>flue-gas desulphurisation (FGD) units</strong> or “scrubbers” in power plants and industries
          to remove SO₂ from exhaust gases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use <strong>low-NOx burners</strong>, combustion modification and catalytic converters in vehicles to reduce
          NOx emissions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adopt <strong>electrostatic precipitators and fabric filters</strong> to capture particulate matter which may
          carry acidic components.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Regulatory and legal measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Set and enforce <strong>emission standards</strong> for SO₂ and NOx for power plants, industries and
          automobiles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Introduce policies like <strong>“cap-and-trade”</strong> for sulphur and nitrogen emissions, where total
          emissions are capped and pollution permits are traded among industries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage or mandate the use of <strong>cleaner fuels and technologies</strong> through environmental laws,
          taxes and subsidies.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. International cooperation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Since acid rain pollutants can cross national borders, neighbouring countries must cooperate to reduce
          regional emissions through agreements and joint programmes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sharing of <strong>data, technology and best practices</strong> helps to reduce acid deposition over wider
          regions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Public awareness and local initiatives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Educating the public about the link between <strong>energy use, air pollution and acid rain</strong> can
          promote energy-saving behaviours and support for clean-energy policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Citizens can contribute by using <strong>public transport, conserving electricity, avoiding open burning of
          waste</strong> and supporting afforestation and pollution-control efforts.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>VI. Exam-oriented recap (how to write this answer)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with a clear definition of acid rain and mention the critical pH value (below 5.6).</li>
        <li>Explain briefly the chemical formation of sulphuric and nitric acids from SO₂ and NOx.</li>
        <li>List major causes: power plants, industries, vehicles, domestic fuel use and long-range transport.</li>
        <li>Discuss effects systematically under separate headings: soil, water bodies, forests/vegetation, buildings/monuments, and human health.</li>
        <li>Give well-organised control measures: cleaner fuels, emission control technologies, legal measures, international cooperation and public awareness.</li>
        <li>End with a value-based conclusion linking acid rain control with responsible energy use and sustainable development.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> In conclusion, acid rain is an important manifestation of air pollution, produced
        when sulphur and nitrogen oxides from human activities are converted into strong acids and returned to the
        Earth through precipitation. It damages soils, lakes, forests, crops and cultural monuments and indirectly
        affects human health and economy. At the same time, the causes of acid rain—chiefly the way we generate and use
        energy—are within human control. Through cleaner fuels, efficient technologies, strict emission standards,
        regional cooperation and greater public awareness, the problem of acid rain can be significantly reduced.
        Ultimately, controlling acid rain is part of the broader responsibility to manage our energy use wisely and
        live in harmony with the environment.
