    <article>
      <p>
        <strong>Introduction.</strong> In the present era of rapid industrialisation, urban expansion and technological
        growth, human beings are modifying the environment at an unprecedented rate. When these modifications cross
        the self-purifying capacity of nature, air becomes unbreathable, water undrinkable and soil unfit for
        productive use. This deterioration of environmental quality due to unwanted additions of substances and forms
        of energy is known as <strong>environmental pollution</strong>. It is one of the central themes of Environmental
        Studies because it directly threatens human health, ecosystems and sustainable development.
      </p>

      <h2>Meaning and definition of environmental pollution</h2>
      <p>
        In general, <strong>pollution</strong> means making something dirty, impure or harmful. When this happens to
        our surroundings, we call it environmental pollution.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Definition (exam-oriented):</strong></p>
      <p style="margin-left:16px;">
        <em>“Environmental pollution is the undesirable change in the physical, chemical or biological characteristics
        of air, water, soil or other environmental components, mainly due to human activities, in such a way that it
        becomes harmful to human health, other living organisms, property or normal ecological processes.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The agents which cause pollution are called <strong>pollutants</strong>. They may be in the <strong>solid,
        liquid or gaseous state</strong>, or in the form of <strong>heat, noise or radiation</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Concept of environmental pollution</h2>
      <p>
        The concept of environmental pollution may be understood through the following key ideas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Pollution always implies a <strong>qualitative deterioration</strong> of environmental quality – for example,
          when pure water is contaminated with sewage, industrial effluents or toxic chemicals.
        </li>
        <li>
          A substance becomes a pollutant when its <strong>concentration, duration or place of occurrence</strong>
          exceeds the normal limits. Even naturally occurring substances (CO₂, nutrients, heat) can act as pollutants
          when present in excess.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pollutants may originate from <strong>point sources</strong> (a chimney, a drain, a factory outlet) or
          <strong>non-point/diffuse sources</strong> (runoff from fields, emissions from millions of vehicles).
        </li>
        <li>
          Effects of pollution may be <strong>local (noise near a construction site)</strong>,
          <strong>regional (acid rain)</strong> or <strong>global (greenhouse gases and climate change)</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Environmental pollution disturbs the <strong>structure and functioning of ecosystems</strong> and may cause
          long-term and sometimes irreversible damage.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Major sources of environmental pollution</h2>
      <p>
        Sources of pollution can be divided into <strong>natural</strong> and
        <strong>anthropogenic (man-made)</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Natural sources (briefly)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Volcanic eruptions releasing ash, gases and dust into the atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Natural forest fires producing smoke and particulates.</li>
        <li>Dust storms in deserts, pollen grains, decomposition of organic matter, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Generally, natural processes are balanced by the self-cleansing capacity of the environment. Serious pollution
        problems arise mainly from <strong>anthropogenic sources</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Anthropogenic (man-made) sources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Industrial activities:</strong> Factories, refineries, thermal power plants, cement, paper, textile
          and chemical industries emit gases (SO₂, NOx, CO, hydrocarbons), particulate matter, toxic chemicals, hot
          water and solid wastes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transport sector:</strong> Emissions from motor vehicles, aircraft, ships and trains cause air and
          noise pollution and add greenhouse gases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Domestic and commercial activities:</strong> Burning of coal, wood, LPG and waste; detergents and
          sewage from households; noise from loudspeakers and appliances.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Agricultural practices:</strong> Excessive use of fertilisers, pesticides and weedicides; open
          burning of crop residues; improper disposal of livestock wastes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Urbanisation and solid waste:</strong> Municipal solid waste, plastics, biomedical waste and
          e-waste from growing cities and towns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mining and quarrying:</strong> Dust, noise, overburden, mine drainage and chemical contamination of
          nearby land and water.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Different types of environmental pollution</h2>
      <p>
        For EVS, the main types of pollution to be described are: <strong>air, water, soil (land), noise, thermal and
        radioactive pollution</strong>. Sometimes solid waste pollution and light pollution are mentioned separately.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Air pollution</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Meaning:</strong> Degradation of air quality due to the presence of harmful gases, vapours, fumes and
          particulate matter in concentrations that are dangerous to living beings and materials.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Examples of pollutants:</strong> SO₂, NOx, CO, CO₂ (in excess), SPM/PM₂.₅, ozone (at ground level),
          hydrocarbons, lead and other toxic substances.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Water pollution</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Meaning:</strong> Unfavourable change in the physical, chemical or biological properties of water
          that makes it unfit for drinking, domestic use, agriculture, fisheries or other purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Key pollutants:</strong> Sewage, industrial effluents, agricultural runoff with fertilisers and
          pesticides, heavy metals, oil, plastics and pathogens.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Soil (land) pollution</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Meaning:</strong> Degradation of soil quality and productivity through the presence of harmful
          chemicals, solid wastes and salts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pollutants:</strong> Excess fertilisers and pesticides, industrial solid waste, fly ash, plastics,
          biomedical and hazardous wastes, heavy metals.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Noise pollution</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Meaning:</strong> Unwanted, unpleasant or excessive sound that interferes with normal activities and
          causes adverse effects on human beings and animals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sources:</strong> Vehicles, aircraft, railways, construction equipment, factories, loudspeakers and
          household appliances.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Thermal pollution</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Meaning:</strong> Undesirable rise in the temperature of natural water bodies due to discharge of hot
          water from power plants and industries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Effect:</strong> Reduced dissolved oxygen, death of sensitive aquatic organisms and alteration of
          species composition.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Radioactive pollution</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Meaning:</strong> Contamination of the environment by radioactive substances, leading to exposure to
          ionising radiation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sources:</strong> Nuclear power plants, nuclear tests (historically), medical and research uses,
          improper disposal of radioactive waste and accidents.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Causes of environmental pollution (underlying drivers)</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond immediate sources, some broad <strong>root causes</strong> explain why pollution is increasing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Rapid population growth:</strong> Higher population means greater demand for food, water, housing,
          energy and transport, leading to increased pressure on resources and greater waste generation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Industrialisation and urbanisation:</strong> Concentration of industries and people in limited
          spaces results in heavy emissions and waste discharge without adequate treatment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unsustainable consumption patterns:</strong> “Use-and-throw” culture, luxury lifestyles, dependence
          on private vehicles and heavy use of plastics and packaging.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dependence on fossil fuels:</strong> Coal, petroleum and natural gas are the primary energy sources,
          producing large amounts of air pollutants and greenhouse gases when burnt.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inadequate environmental planning and waste management:</strong> Lack of proper sewage systems,
          treatment plants, scientific landfills and pollution-control devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Poverty, lack of awareness and weak enforcement:</strong> Poor people may be forced to use polluting
          fuels and methods, while weak enforcement of laws allows industries and individuals to violate standards.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Consequences of environmental pollution</h2>

      <h3>A. Consequences on human health</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Respiratory and cardiovascular diseases:</strong> Air pollutants cause asthma, bronchitis, COPD,
          reduced lung function, high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Water-borne diseases:</strong> Polluted water leads to diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid, dysentery,
          hepatitis and many gastrointestinal infections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chemical toxicity:</strong> Long-term exposure to heavy metals, pesticides and other toxic chemicals
          may cause cancers, neurological disorders, damage to liver and kidneys, and reproductive problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Noise-related health effects:</strong> Hearing loss, sleep disturbance, stress, irritability, reduced
          concentration and general mental fatigue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Radiation impacts:</strong> Radiation can cause genetic mutations, birth defects and various forms of
          cancer, with long-lasting hereditary effects.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B. Consequences on ecosystems and biodiversity</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Habitat degradation:</strong> Acid rain, smog, contaminated water and solid waste degrade forests,
          grasslands, wetlands and aquatic ecosystems, reducing their productivity and stability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Loss of species and biodiversity:</strong> Sensitive species of fish, amphibians, corals, birds and
          insects may die out locally or become endangered due to polluted habitats.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bioaccumulation and biomagnification:</strong> Persistent pollutants (e.g., pesticides, heavy metals)
          accumulate in organisms and magnify along food chains, severely affecting top predators and ultimately human
          beings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Disruption of ecological processes:</strong> Pollution alters nutrient cycles, primary productivity,
          decomposition and food web relationships, leading to reduced resilience of ecosystems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Global effects:</strong> Greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change; chlorofluorocarbons
          (CFCs) deplete the ozone layer, increasing harmful UV radiation reaching the earth’s surface.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Control measures to mitigate environmental pollution</h2>
      <p>
        Effective control of pollution requires a combination of <strong>technological, legal, economic and
        educational</strong> measures. Some major strategies are:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Technological and engineering measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cleaner production and fuels:</strong> Shift from coal and heavy oil to cleaner fuels (CNG, LPG,
          low-sulphur fuel) and promote renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and small hydel power.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pollution-control devices:</strong> Use electrostatic precipitators, filters and scrubbers in
          industries; catalytic converters in vehicles to reduce harmful emissions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Treatment of wastes:</strong> Establish sewage treatment plants (STPs) and effluent treatment plants
          (ETPs) so that no untreated sewage or industrial effluent is released into water bodies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scientific solid waste management:</strong> Encourage segregation at source, recycling and composting;
          reduce landfilling and avoid open dumping and burning.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Legal and regulatory measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Strict implementation of environmental laws such as the <em>Water Act</em>, <em>Air Act</em> and
          <em>Environment (Protection) Act, 1986</em>, and rules related to hazardous waste, biomedical waste and
          plastic waste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Setting and enforcing standards for emission, effluent discharge and noise levels; regular monitoring by
          pollution control boards.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mandatory <strong>Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)</strong> for major projects to identify and minimise
          potential pollution before implementation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Economic and planning measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use of <strong>“polluter pays” principle</strong>, fines and charges on excessive pollution to discourage
          harmful practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Subsidies, tax benefits and soft loans for adopting clean technologies, renewable energy and waste-reduction
          measures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Urban and regional planning that provides adequate green belts, proper zoning of industrial and residential
          areas, and sufficient infrastructure for waste treatment.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Educational, social and behavioural measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Environmental education</strong> at school, college and community level to create awareness about
          causes, effects and prevention of pollution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Public participation in environmental decision-making, clean-up campaigns, tree plantation drives and local
          monitoring of pollution sources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Promotion of <strong>eco-friendly lifestyles</strong>: using public transport, saving electricity and water,
          reducing plastic use, practising “3Rs” – reduce, reuse, recycle.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exam-oriented recap (how to write the 15-mark answer)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with a neat introduction and precise definition of environmental pollution.</li>
        <li>Explain the concept (qualitative change, pollutants, point/non-point, local/global).</li>
        <li>Describe major sources (natural vs anthropogenic) with 4–5 clear human sources.</li>
        <li>List and briefly explain main types: air, water, soil, noise, thermal, radioactive.</li>
        <li>Write separate headings for causes, consequences on human health and consequences on ecosystems.</li>
        <li>Give well-organised control measures: technological, legal, economic and educational/social.</li>
        <li>End with a strong conclusion linking pollution control with sustainable development and human responsibility.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> To conclude, environmental pollution may be defined as the harmful alteration of
        our surroundings by human activities. It arises from multiple sources, appears in different forms and has
        serious consequences for both human health and ecosystems. At the same time, it is not an inevitable outcome
        of development. Through scientific technologies, strict enforcement of laws, rational planning, economic
        incentives and a change in individual and social behaviour, the impact of pollution can be significantly
        reduced. Thus, controlling environmental pollution is an essential pre-condition for achieving healthy,
        equitable and sustainable development for present and future generations.
