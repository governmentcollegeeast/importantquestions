      Section B — Q9. What is ozone depletion? What are its primary causes and what consequences does it pose for life
      on Earth?
      <span style="color:var(--muted);">(Answer framed approximately for 15 marks)</span>
    </p>

    <article>
      <p>
        <strong>Introduction.</strong> The atmosphere is not just a mixture of gases; it is a carefully organised
        life-support system. One of its most vital components is the <strong>ozone layer</strong>, a thin shield of
        gas high above the Earth that protects living beings from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.
        During the last few decades, human activities have thinned this protective shield – a phenomenon known as
        <strong>ozone depletion</strong>. Understanding the meaning, causes and consequences of ozone depletion is
        therefore an important part of Environmental Studies.
      </p>

      <h2>I. Ozone and the ozone layer – basic concept</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Ozone (O₃)</strong> is a form of oxygen in which three oxygen atoms are bonded together. It occurs in
        two main regions of the atmosphere:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the <strong>stratosphere</strong> (about 10–50 km above the Earth’s surface) forming the
          <strong>ozone layer</strong> or “ozonosphere”, which is beneficial.
        </li>
        <li>
          Near the <strong>ground level (troposphere)</strong> as a component of photochemical smog, where it is a
          harmful pollutant.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The stratospheric ozone layer absorbs most of the <strong>biologically harmful UV-B and UV-C radiation</strong>
        from the sun, allowing only a small, safe portion to reach the Earth’s surface. In this way, it acts like a
        natural <strong>“sunscreen”</strong> or protective shield for life on Earth.
      </p>

      <h2>II. Meaning and definition of ozone depletion</h2>
      <p>
        Ozone in the stratosphere is continuously formed and destroyed through natural chemical reactions involving
        oxygen and sunlight. Under natural conditions, this formation–destruction cycle remains in balance and the
        total amount of ozone remains more or less constant.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Definition (exam-oriented):</strong></p>
      <p style="margin-left:16px;">
        <em>“Ozone depletion refers to the gradual thinning and reduction in the concentration of ozone in the
        stratospheric ozone layer, particularly over the polar regions, mainly due to human-made chemicals that destroy
        ozone molecules.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In simple words, ozone depletion means that the ozone shield is becoming <strong>thinner</strong> than before,
        thus allowing more harmful UV radiation to reach the Earth’s surface.
      </p>

      <h2>III. Primary causes of ozone depletion</h2>
      <p>
        While some natural processes can influence ozone levels, the major cause of recent ozone depletion is the
        emission of certain <strong>man-made chemicals</strong> that destroy ozone in the stratosphere. These chemicals
        are stable in the lower atmosphere, but are broken down by strong UV radiation in the stratosphere, releasing
        reactive atoms that attack ozone molecules.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>CFCs</strong> are synthetic compounds containing chlorine, fluorine and carbon. They were widely
          used in:
          <ul>
            <li>Refrigerators and air-conditioners (as coolants/refrigerants),</li>
            <li>Aerosol sprays (as propellants),</li>
            <li>Foam-blowing agents (for making foamed plastics), and</li>
            <li>Electronic cleaning solvents.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          CFC molecules are very stable in the lower atmosphere and can remain for many years. When they slowly drift
          up into the stratosphere, strong UV radiation breaks them down, releasing <strong>chlorine atoms (Cl)</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          A single chlorine atom can destroy thousands of ozone molecules through a <strong>chain reaction</strong>,
          leading to significant depletion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Halons and other chlorine- and bromine-containing substances</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Halons</strong>, used mainly in fire extinguishers, contain bromine along with carbon and other
          elements. Bromine atoms are even more efficient than chlorine in destroying ozone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other ozone-depleting substances (ODS) include <strong>carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and methyl
          bromide</strong> (a soil fumigant/insecticide).
        </li>
        <li>
          All these substances release chlorine or bromine in the stratosphere, accelerating ozone depletion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) from high-flying aircraft and other sources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Oxides of nitrogen (NO and NO₂)</strong> can also participate in reactions that destroy ozone.
        </li>
        <li>
          These may be produced in the stratosphere from high-altitude supersonic aircraft, combustion processes and
          some natural sources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Although their contribution is smaller compared to CFCs and halons, they still play a role in ozone loss.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Special phenomenon: Antarctic “ozone hole”</h3>
      <p>
        Ozone depletion is particularly severe over the Antarctic region, leading to the formation of the so-called
        <strong>“ozone hole”</strong> during late winter and early spring.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Extremely low temperatures over Antarctica in winter lead to the formation of <strong>polar stratospheric
          clouds (PSCs)</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chemical reactions on the surface of these clouds convert inactive forms of chlorine into more reactive forms.
        </li>
        <li>
          When sunlight returns in spring, these reactive chlorine species rapidly destroy ozone, causing a sharp drop
          in ozone concentration – observed as the ozone hole.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Thus, the primary causes of ozone depletion are <strong>anthropogenic emissions of ozone-depleting
        substances</strong> such as CFCs, halons and certain industrial chemicals, combined with special meteorological
        conditions over the polar regions.
      </p>

      <h2>IV. Consequences of ozone depletion for life on Earth</h2>
      <p>
        The main effect of ozone depletion is an increase in the amount of <strong>UV-B radiation</strong> reaching the
        Earth’s surface. UV-B (wavelength 280–320 nm) is particularly harmful to living organisms. The consequences can
        be discussed under separate headings for humans, other organisms and materials.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Effects on human health</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Skin cancer:</strong> Increased UV-B exposure raises the risk of various types of skin cancer,
          especially in fair-skinned populations, but all humans are potentially vulnerable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Eye damage and cataracts:</strong> UV radiation can damage the lens and other parts of the eye,
          leading to <strong>cataracts and loss of vision</strong> if exposure is high and prolonged.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Suppression of immune system:</strong> Excess UV-B may weaken the human <strong>immune system</strong>,
          making individuals more susceptible to infections and possibly reducing the effectiveness of vaccines.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sunburn and premature ageing:</strong> Higher UV levels increase cases of sunburn, skin irritation
          and premature ageing of the skin.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Effects on plants and terrestrial ecosystems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          UV-B can affect the <strong>growth, photosynthesis and flowering</strong> of many crop plants and wild
          species.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sensitive crops (e.g., some varieties of wheat, barley, soybean, maize and vegetables) may show reduced
          yield, quality or changes in plant structure when UV levels increase.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes in plant growth patterns can disturb <strong>terrestrial food chains and ecosystem balance</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Effects on aquatic life and marine ecosystems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          UV radiation penetrates the upper layers of oceans, lakes and rivers, affecting <strong>phytoplankton</strong>
          – the microscopic plants that form the base of aquatic food chains.
        </li>
        <li>
          Damage to phytoplankton reduces <strong>primary productivity</strong> and affects the entire marine food web,
          including fish and higher animals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eggs and larvae of fish, shrimp, crab, amphibians and other aquatic organisms are particularly sensitive to
          increased UV exposure, leading to higher mortality and reduced recruitment.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Effects on materials and non-living environment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Increased UV-B radiation accelerates the <strong>degradation of plastics, rubber, paints and other
          materials</strong>, reducing their useful life and increasing maintenance costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          It may also contribute to weathering of wood, fabrics and certain building materials.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Indirect effects on climate and biogeochemical cycles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ozone itself is a greenhouse gas, so changes in its concentration can influence the <strong>energy balance of
          the atmosphere</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes in UV radiation can affect <strong>biogeochemical cycles</strong> such as carbon and nitrogen cycles,
          altering the functioning of ecosystems in complex ways.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>V. International response (brief mention)</h2>
      <p>
        Although the question does not explicitly ask about control measures, a brief mention of the global response
        strengthens a 15-mark answer and links to later questions on environmental law:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The seriousness of ozone depletion led to international agreements such as the
          <strong>Vienna Convention (1985)</strong> and the <strong>Montreal Protocol (1987)</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          These agreements aim to <strong>phase out the production and use of ozone-depleting substances</strong> like
          CFCs and halons.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Montreal Protocol is often cited as a successful example of global environmental cooperation, with
          gradual signs of recovery in the ozone layer where controls have been effective.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>VI. Exam-oriented recap (how to write the answer)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with a short introduction on the importance of the ozone layer as a protective shield.</li>
        <li>Define ozone depletion clearly and in simple language (thinning of the stratospheric ozone layer).</li>
        <li>Explain briefly what ozone and the ozone layer are, and how they function.</li>
        <li>Under “Primary causes”, emphasise CFCs, halons and other chlorine/bromine compounds; mention NOx and the Antarctic ozone hole.</li>
        <li>Discuss consequences systematically under headings: human health, plants and crops, aquatic life, materials and indirect climatic/ecosystem effects.</li>
        <li>Add 3–4 lines on international efforts like the Montreal Protocol to show awareness of solutions.</li>
        <li>Conclude with a value-based statement about the need to protect the ozone shield for safeguarding all life on Earth.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> To conclude, <strong>ozone depletion</strong> is the thinning of the protective
        stratospheric ozone layer due mainly to human-made chemicals such as CFCs, halons and other ozone-depleting
        substances. This thinning allows more harmful UV-B radiation to reach the Earth’s surface, with serious
        consequences for human health (skin cancer, eye damage, immune suppression), plant growth, marine ecosystems,
        materials and long-term ecological balance. The problem of ozone depletion clearly shows how human activities
        can unintentionally disturb vital atmospheric processes, but it also demonstrates that <strong>international
        cooperation and strong environmental policies</strong> can reverse damage. Protecting the ozone layer is thus
        an essential part of safeguarding life on Earth and ensuring a healthy environment for present and future
        generations.
