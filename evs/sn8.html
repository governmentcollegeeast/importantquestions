    <p class="question">
      Short Note (h). Name the person and Indian State that were the focal point of the Chipko Movement.
      <span style="color:var(--muted);">(Answer framed approximately for 10 marks)</span>
    </p>

    <article>
      <p>
        <strong>Direct answer to the fill-in.</strong>  
        Under this question, the expected answer is that the Chipko Movement was associated mainly with 
        <strong>Sunderlal Bahuguna</strong> and was centred in the hill region of present-day 
        <strong>Uttarakhand</strong> (at that time part of the state of Uttar Pradesh).
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction: What was the Chipko Movement?</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Chipko Movement</strong> was a famous people’s movement for the protection of forests.
        It began in the early 1970s in the Himalayan villages of northern India. The word <em>“Chipko”</em>
        literally means “to hug” or “to cling”. Villagers, especially women, embraced trees and formed
        human chains around them to prevent contractors from cutting them. The movement is considered a
        landmark in the history of environmentalism and forest conservation in India.
      </p>

      <h2>The person: Sunderlal Bahuguna</h2>
      <p>
        The person most closely identified with the Chipko Movement is <strong>Sunderlal Bahuguna</strong>,
        a noted Gandhian environmentalist and social worker. He:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Travelled extensively from village to village, educating people about the ecological value of forests.</li>
        <li>Used <strong>non-violent methods</strong>, fasts and padyatras (foot marches) to mobilise public opinion.</li>
        <li>Emphasised that forests are not merely a source of timber, but a <strong>“life-support system”</strong> for hill communities—protecting soil, water and climate.</li>
        <li>Became the moral and intellectual leader of the movement, giving it national and international visibility.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Along with Sunderlal Bahuguna, leaders such as <strong>Chandi Prasad Bhatt</strong> and many local women
        activists (like Gaura Devi) played a crucial role. However, in examination answers when one name is asked,
        the focal person mentioned is usually <strong>Sunderlal Bahuguna</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>The State: Uttarakhand (then part of Uttar Pradesh)</h2>
      <p>
        The Chipko Movement started in the <strong>Garhwal region of the Himalayas</strong>, in villages of
        what is now the state of <strong>Uttarakhand</strong>. At that time, this region formed part of the
        larger state of <strong>Uttar Pradesh</strong>, but in Environmental Studies books and present usage,
        it is commonly referred to as <strong>Uttarakhand (Himalayan hill state)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Important centres of the movement included places like <strong>Chamoli district</strong> and nearby
        hill villages, where local communities depended heavily on forests for fuelwood, fodder, water and
        protection from soil erosion and landslides.
      </p>

      <h2>Significance of identifying person and state</h2>
      <p>
        Naming the person and state linked with the Chipko Movement is not just a memory exercise; it highlights
        some broader points important for Environmental Studies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The movement shows how <strong>local communities</strong>, especially villagers and women, can successfully resist environmentally destructive policies.</li>
        <li>It emphasises that <strong>Himalayan forests</strong> are vital for soil conservation, water regulation and prevention of disasters in states like Uttarakhand.</li>
        <li>It connects environmental protection with <strong>Gandhian methods</strong> of non-violence, satyagraha and moral persuasion, as used by Sunderlal Bahuguna.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exam-oriented recap</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The question asks specifically for the <strong>person</strong> and the <strong>Indian state</strong> associated with the Chipko Movement.</li>
        <li>The key person: <strong>Sunderlal Bahuguna</strong> (Gandhian environmentalist and leading figure of Chipko).</li>
        <li>The state: <strong>Uttarakhand</strong> (then hill region of Uttar Pradesh) in the Himalayan belt.</li>
        <li>Optional mention (if space allows): The movement began in Garhwal region; villagers hugged trees to stop commercial felling of forests.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Thus, the Chipko Movement is mainly associated with <strong>Sunderlal Bahuguna</strong> 
        and the Himalayan hill state of <strong>Uttarakhand</strong> (earlier a part of Uttar Pradesh). Together, they became 
        a powerful symbol of people’s participation in forest conservation and of the close relationship between hill 
        communities and their surrounding natural environment.
