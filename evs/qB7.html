      Section B — Q7. What is the greenhouse effect? Explain its role in maintaining Earth’s temperature and how human
      activities have intensified it.
      <span style="color:var(--muted);">(Answer framed approximately for 15 marks)</span>
    </p>

    <article>
      <p>
        <strong>Introduction.</strong> Life on Earth is possible only within a narrow range of temperature. If the
        planet were too cold, water would remain frozen and most life processes would stop; if it were too hot,
        proteins and enzymes would be destroyed. The Earth’s atmosphere acts like a protective blanket, regulating
        temperature through a natural process known as the <strong>greenhouse effect</strong>. In Environmental
        Studies, it is very important to distinguish between this <strong>natural greenhouse effect</strong> (which is
        beneficial and essential for life) and the <strong>enhanced greenhouse effect</strong> caused by human
        activities, which leads to global warming and climate change.
      </p>

      <h2>Meaning and definition of the greenhouse effect</h2>
      <p>
        The term “greenhouse” comes from glass houses used to grow plants in cold climates. Glass allows sunlight to
        enter but traps heat inside, keeping the interior warm. The Earth’s atmosphere performs a somewhat similar
        function using certain gases.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Definition (exam-oriented):</strong></p>
      <p style="margin-left:16px;">
        <em>“The greenhouse effect is the process by which certain gases in the Earth’s atmosphere (called greenhouse
        gases) permit incoming solar radiation to reach the Earth’s surface but absorb and re-radiate outgoing
        long-wave (infrared) radiation, thereby trapping heat and keeping the planet warmer than it would otherwise
        be.”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The gases chiefly responsible for this effect are known as <strong>greenhouse gases (GHGs)</strong>. The most
        important among them are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Carbon dioxide (CO₂)</li>
        <li>Methane (CH₄)</li>
        <li>Nitrous oxide (N₂O)</li>
        <li>Water vapour (H₂O)</li>
        <li>Ozone (O₃) in the lower atmosphere</li>
        <li>Industrial gases such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HCFCs, HFCs, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mechanism of the natural greenhouse effect</h2>
      <p>
        The working of the greenhouse effect can be explained step by step. In the exam, you can convert this into a
        neat labelled diagram, but here we describe it in words:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Incoming solar radiation (short-wave)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The sun emits energy in the form of <strong>short-wave radiation</strong> (visible light, some ultraviolet
          and near infrared).
        </li>
        <li>
          About <strong>one-third</strong> of this incoming solar radiation is reflected back to space by clouds,
          atmospheric particles and the Earth’s surface (albedo effect).
        </li>
        <li>
          The remaining portion passes through the atmosphere and is absorbed by the Earth’s surface (land and oceans),
          thereby warming it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Outgoing long-wave (infrared) radiation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The warmed Earth does not keep all the energy it receives; it tries to maintain balance by
          <strong>re-radiating energy back into space</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          This outgoing energy is in the form of <strong>long-wave infrared radiation</strong>, not visible light.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Absorption and re-radiation by greenhouse gases</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere <strong>absorb a portion</strong> of this outgoing infrared radiation.
        </li>
        <li>
          After absorbing energy, these gases re-radiate it in all directions, including back towards the Earth’s
          surface and lower atmosphere.
        </li>
        <li>
          This process effectively <strong>traps heat</strong> within the lower atmosphere, much like the glass of a
          greenhouse, and keeps surface temperatures higher than they would be otherwise.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Resulting equilibrium temperature</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Without the natural greenhouse effect, scientists estimate that the average surface temperature of the Earth
          would be around <strong>-18°C</strong>, which is far too cold for most present-day life forms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Due to the greenhouse effect, the actual global average surface temperature is approximately
          <strong>+15°C</strong>, which is suitable for liquid water and complex life.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Thus, the <strong>natural greenhouse effect is a life-supporting phenomenon</strong>. It maintains a
        comfortable temperature range and enables the existence of ecosystems and human civilisation.
      </p>

      <h2>Role of the greenhouse effect in maintaining Earth’s temperature</h2>
      <p>
        In Environmental Studies, it is important to highlight the positive, natural role of the greenhouse effect
        before criticising its human-induced enhancement.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It acts as a <strong>“thermal blanket”</strong> around the Earth, preventing rapid loss of heat to outer
          space during night and in colder regions.
        </li>
        <li>
          It helps maintain <strong>moderate day–night temperature differences</strong>. Without it, days would be
          very hot and nights extremely cold, making life difficult.
        </li>
        <li>
          It ensures that water remains predominantly in the <strong>liquid state</strong> over large parts of the
          planet, enabling the hydrological cycle (evaporation, condensation, rainfall).
        </li>
        <li>
          It provides a stable thermal environment in which <strong>ecosystems can evolve</strong>, agriculture can
          flourish and human societies can develop.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Therefore, when we talk of the greenhouse effect, we must remember that:
        <strong>“Greenhouse effect itself is not harmful; it is the excessive or enhanced greenhouse effect which is a
        problem.”</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>How human activities have intensified the greenhouse effect</h2>
      <p>
        Human beings, especially since the Industrial Revolution, have significantly altered the composition of the
        atmosphere. This has led to an <strong>enhanced greenhouse effect</strong>, sometimes called the
        <strong>anthropogenic greenhouse effect</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Burning of fossil fuels</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The largest source of additional greenhouse gases is the <strong>combustion of fossil fuels</strong> (coal,
          oil, natural gas) for electricity generation, transportation, industry and domestic use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Burning these fuels releases huge amounts of <strong>CO₂</strong> into the atmosphere, increasing its
          concentration far above pre-industrial levels.
        </li>
        <li>
          As CO₂ is a major greenhouse gas, this directly strengthens the greenhouse effect.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Deforestation and land-use change</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Forests act as important <strong>carbon sinks</strong>, absorbing CO₂ during photosynthesis and storing
          carbon in biomass and soil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Large-scale cutting and burning of forests for agriculture, urbanisation, mining and infrastructure releases
          stored carbon and reduces the Earth’s capacity to absorb future emissions.
        </li>
        <li>
          This combination of <strong>extra CO₂ emissions and reduced absorption</strong> further intensifies the
          greenhouse effect.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Agriculture and livestock</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Methane (CH₄)</strong> is a potent greenhouse gas. It is released from flooded rice fields, digestive
          processes of cattle and sheep (enteric fermentation), manure storage, and decomposition of organic waste.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nitrous oxide (N₂O)</strong> is released from soils due to excessive use of nitrogenous fertilisers
          and from some industrial processes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Both methane and nitrous oxide have a much higher <strong>global warming potential</strong> per molecule than
          CO₂, so their increasing concentrations significantly enhance the greenhouse effect.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Industrial gases and products</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Human industrial activities have produced entirely <strong>synthetic greenhouse gases</strong>, such as
          chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HCFCs and HFCs, used in refrigeration, air-conditioning, aerosols and foam
          production.
        </li>
        <li>
          These gases are extremely powerful greenhouse agents and also contribute to <strong>ozone layer depletion</strong>
          (in the case of CFCs and some related compounds).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Waste generation and improper waste management</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Landfills and open dumps</strong> produce methane as organic waste decomposes under anaerobic
          conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Open burning of solid waste releases CO₂, black carbon and other pollutants, adding to the greenhouse burden.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Urbanisation and energy-intensive lifestyles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Rapid urban growth leads to increased demand for <strong>electricity, transport, cement, steel, construction
          materials and consumer goods</strong>, all of which are energy-intensive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cities create <strong>urban heat islands</strong> and adopt high-consumption lifestyles, further increasing
          overall greenhouse gas emissions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>From enhanced greenhouse effect to global warming</h2>
      <p>
        It is useful to clarify the relationship between the greenhouse effect and global warming, because examiners
        often expect this distinction:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <strong>greenhouse effect</strong> is the physical process by which greenhouse gases trap heat in the
          atmosphere.
        </li>
        <li>
          When human activities increase the concentration of greenhouse gases, the greenhouse effect is
          <strong>enhanced</strong>, leading to an overall warming of the Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere.
        </li>
        <li>
          This observable increase in average global temperature due to the enhanced greenhouse effect is called
          <strong>global warming</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Global warming, in turn, is a major driver of <strong>climate change</strong>, leading to changing rainfall
          patterns, melting of ice, sea-level rise and more extreme weather events.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Environmental and societal implications of the intensified greenhouse effect (brief overview)</h2>
      <p>
        Although the question focuses mainly on the role and intensification of the greenhouse effect, a brief mention
        of its implications strengthens a 15-mark answer:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Rising temperatures</strong> and increased frequency of <strong>heat waves</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Melting glaciers</strong> and polar ice, contributing to <strong>sea-level rise</strong> and coastal
          flooding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes in <strong>monsoon behaviour</strong>, rainfall distribution and water availability, affecting
          agriculture and food security.
        </li>
        <li>
          More frequent and intense <strong>extreme events</strong> such as floods, droughts and cyclones.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stress on ecosystems and biodiversity; shifts in species ranges and possible extinctions of sensitive species.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exam-oriented recap (how to present this answer for full marks)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with a short introduction linking life on Earth with temperature regulation by the atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Give a clear, one- or two-line definition of the greenhouse effect and list major greenhouse gases.</li>
        <li>Explain the mechanism stepwise: incoming solar radiation, absorption by Earth, outgoing infrared radiation, absorption and re-radiation by greenhouse gases.</li>
        <li>Highlight the positive role of the <strong>natural</strong> greenhouse effect in maintaining Earth’s average temperature around 15°C.</li>
        <li>Then, under a separate heading, discuss how human activities (fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture, industry, waste, urbanisation) have increased greenhouse gas concentrations.</li>
        <li>Clarify the link between enhanced greenhouse effect, global warming and climate change.</li>
        <li>End with 4–5 lines on the broader implications and a value-based conclusion.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> To conclude, the greenhouse effect is a natural and essential process by which
        greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap part of the outgoing infrared radiation and maintain a life-supporting
        temperature on Earth. Without it, our planet would be a frozen world. However, human activities such as burning
        fossil fuels, destroying forests, expanding intensive agriculture, generating industrial gases and mismanaging
        waste have greatly <strong>intensified</strong> this effect. The enhanced greenhouse effect leads to global
        warming and contributes to far-reaching changes in climate, with serious consequences for ecosystems, human
        health, economies and societies. Understanding this distinction between the natural and human-strengthened
        greenhouse effect is fundamental for designing effective policies and personal actions that move us towards
        a low-carbon, climate-friendly and sustainable future.
