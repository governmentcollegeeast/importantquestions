      <p>
        <strong>Introduction.</strong> Human civilisation has developed and flourished by using materials and services
        obtained from nature. The food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe, the clothes we wear, the houses
        we live in and the energy we use – all ultimately come from nature. In Environmental Studies, these gifts of
        nature which can be used to satisfy human needs are called <strong>natural resources</strong>. Understanding
        their meaning, proper classification and wise use is essential for sustainable development.
      </p>

      <h2>Meaning and definition of Natural Resources</h2>
      <p>
        In simple words, <strong>natural resources</strong> are all those materials and forces that we obtain from
        nature and use for our survival, comfort and economic activity.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
      <p style="margin-left:16px;">
        <em>“Natural resources are the components of nature – such as air, water, soil, minerals, forests, wildlife,
        energy, etc. – which can be used by human beings to satisfy their needs and wants, and which have economic,
        ecological or aesthetic value.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, natural resources include both <strong>living (biotic)</strong> components like plants and animals,
        and <strong>non-living (abiotic)</strong> components like land, water, air, minerals and energy sources.
      </p>

      <h2>Concept of Natural Resources (detailed explanation)</h2>
      <p>
        The concept of natural resources in Environmental Science goes beyond the narrow economic view. It includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Utility:</strong> The resource must have some actual or potential use for humans (e.g., water for
          drinking and irrigation, forests for timber and climate regulation, coal for energy).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Availability in nature:</strong> Resources exist in nature without human creation – humans only
          discover, extract and manage them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ecological value:</strong> Every natural resource is part of an ecosystem and plays a role in
          ecological balance – e.g., forests regulate climate, soil supports plant life, rivers maintain hydrological cycle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dynamic character:</strong> Some resources can be replenished and renewed (like forests, groundwater,
          fish) if used wisely, while others are fixed in amount (like coal, petroleum, many minerals).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Human dependence:</strong> Modern life, industry, agriculture and transport depend heavily on
          continuous and reliable supply of natural resources.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Because human demands are increasing but the Earth’s capacity is limited, it is necessary to study natural
        resources in terms of their <strong>renewability and rate of replenishment</strong>. This leads to an important
        classification into <strong>renewable</strong> and <strong>non-renewable</strong> resources.
      </p>

      <h2>Classification into Renewable and Non-renewable Resources</h2>
      <p>
        On the basis of their ability to regenerate and the time required for replenishment, natural resources are broadly
        classified as:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Renewable resources</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Renewable resources</strong> are those natural resources which can be <strong>replenished or replaced</strong>
        by natural processes within a relatively short period of time, if they are used judiciously. Their supply is not
        fixed; they can regenerate and maintain themselves.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solar energy:</strong> Energy coming from the sun; practically inexhaustible on human time scale.</li>
        <li><strong>Wind energy:</strong> Produced by movement of air masses; can be used through windmills and wind turbines.</li>
        <li><strong>Water (hydrological cycle):</strong> River water, groundwater and rainfall – renewed by evaporation, condensation and precipitation.</li>
        <li><strong>Biomass:</strong> Forests, grasslands, agricultural crops and livestock – capable of regrowth and reproduction.</li>
        <li><strong>Wildlife and fisheries:</strong> If protected from over-exploitation and habitat destruction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, it is important to note that even renewable resources can become <strong>temporarily or permanently
        depleted</strong> if they are overused or mismanaged, e.g., overgrazing leading to desertification, overfishing
        leading to collapse of fish populations, or excessive withdrawal of groundwater causing water table decline.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Non-renewable resources</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Non-renewable resources</strong> are those natural resources which exist in <strong>fixed quantities</strong>
        in the Earth’s crust or atmosphere and are <strong>not replenished</strong> within a human time scale. Once they
        are used up, they cannot be regenerated quickly by natural processes.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fossil fuels:</strong> Coal, petroleum (crude oil), natural gas – formed from remains of plants and animals buried millions of years ago.</li>
        <li><strong>Metallic minerals:</strong> Iron, copper, aluminium, gold, silver, lead, zinc, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-metallic minerals:</strong> Limestone, phosphates, mica, gypsum, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Nuclear minerals:</strong> Uranium, thorium used for nuclear energy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These resources took millions of years to form under geological processes. The rate of their formation is
        extremely slow compared to the rate of human consumption, so for practical purposes they are treated as
        <strong>exhaustible</strong> or finite.
      </p>

      <h2>Difference between Renewable and Non-renewable Resources</h2>
      <p>
        The main points of distinction can be summarised as follows:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Basis</th>
          <th>Renewable Resources</th>
          <th>Non-renewable Resources</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Definition</td>
          <td>Can be regenerated or replenished naturally within a short period of time, if used wisely.</td>
          <td>Exist in fixed quantities; formation takes millions of years; cannot be replenished within human time scale.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Exhaustibility</td>
          <td>Generally inexhaustible on human time scale, but can be depleted by overuse or mismanagement.</td>
          <td>Exhaustible; once used up, they are practically lost forever.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Examples</td>
          <td>Solar energy, wind energy, water, forests, agricultural crops, fisheries.</td>
          <td>Coal, petroleum, natural gas, metallic and non-metallic minerals, uranium, thorium.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Environmental impact</td>
          <td>Usually less polluting if used carefully; can be harnessed through eco-friendly technologies.</td>
          <td>Often associated with high pollution (e.g., burning fossil fuels) and environmental degradation (e.g., mining).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Role in sustainable development</td>
          <td>Form the basis of long-term sustainable energy and resource strategies.</td>
          <td>Must be used sparingly and efficiently; need alternatives and substitutes in the long run.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Illustrative examples (exam-oriented)</h2>
      <h3>(i) Forests as a renewable resource</h3>
      <p>
        Forests provide timber, fuelwood, fodder, fruits, medicines and many non-timber forest products. They also
        protect soil, regulate climate and conserve biodiversity. If forests are harvested scientifically, with
        proper replanting and protection from fire and overgrazing, they are a <strong>renewable resource</strong>.
        But if large-scale deforestation takes place without reforestation, forests may be degraded beyond repair.
      </p>

      <h3>(ii) Petroleum as a non-renewable resource</h3>
      <p>
        Petroleum is the lifeline of modern transport and industry. However, it is a <strong>non-renewable fossil
        fuel</strong> formed over millions of years. Excessive use of petroleum not only leads to depletion of
        reserves but also causes air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Therefore, Environmental
        Science emphasises energy conservation and development of renewable alternatives (solar, wind, biofuels, etc.).
      </p>

      <h2>Importance of this classification</h2>
      <p>
        Distinguishing between renewable and non-renewable resources is important because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It guides <strong>planning and policy-making</strong> for long-term resource security.</li>
        <li>It highlights the need to <strong>conserve non-renewable resources</strong> through efficient use, recycling and substitution.</li>
        <li>It encourages the <strong>promotion of renewable resources</strong> for sustainable development and reduction of pollution.</li>
        <li>It helps citizens understand why careless over-consumption today can lead to shortage and environmental crises tomorrow.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exam-oriented recap (points to remember)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with a clear definition of natural resources – components of nature with utility and value.</li>
        <li>Explain the broader concept: biotic and abiotic, ecological role, human dependence and dynamic character.</li>
        <li>Classify resources into renewable and non-renewable based on ability to regenerate.</li>
        <li>Write neat, separate headings for each type and give at least 3–4 examples for both.</li>
        <li>Add a small comparative table or point-wise difference between the two categories.</li>
        <li>Use 1–2 illustrative examples (e.g., forests vs petroleum) to strengthen the answer.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Natural resources are the fundamental gifts of nature that support human life and
        economic activity. From the viewpoint of Environmental Science, it is essential to understand their meaning,
        classify them into renewable and non-renewable categories and use each type wisely. Renewable resources must be
        conserved and enhanced through proper management, while non-renewable resources must be used sparingly, with
        maximum efficiency and minimum wastage, so that development becomes truly sustainable for present as well as
        future generations.
