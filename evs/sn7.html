    <article>
      <p>
        <strong>Direct answer.</strong> Under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, a <strong>National Biodiversity Authority (NBA)</strong> 
        is created at the national level to oversee biodiversity-related issues in India. It is the apex statutory body for the 
        regulation, conservation and sustainable use of biological resources and for ensuring fair and equitable sharing of benefits.
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction: Need for an apex biodiversity body</h2>
      <p>
        India is one of the world’s <strong>mega-diverse countries</strong>, with a very rich variety of plants, animals, microorganisms 
        and ecosystems. At the same time, there is constant pressure on these resources due to population increase, industrial 
        development, agriculture, bio-prospecting and international trade. To implement the provisions of the <strong>Convention on 
        Biological Diversity (CBD)</strong> and to protect national interests, Parliament enacted the <strong>Biological Diversity Act, 2002</strong>. 
        This Act provides for a three-tier structure of biodiversity management, at the national, state and local levels. At the top of 
        this structure stands the <strong>National Biodiversity Authority</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>What is the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA)?</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>National Biodiversity Authority (NBA)</strong> is a statutory, autonomous body established by the Central Government 
        under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. It is headquartered at Chennai and functions under the overall control of the 
        Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The Authority consists of a Chairperson and other members, including experts 
        from different fields such as conservation biology, forestry, agriculture, law, tribal affairs and others, as prescribed by the Act.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a national-level organisation, NBA plays a <strong>co-ordinating, regulatory and advisory role</strong> for all matters 
        relating to access to biological resources, protection of traditional knowledge and benefit-sharing.
      </p>

      <h2>Key functions of the National Biodiversity Authority</h2>
      <p>Important functions of the NBA, as highlighted in EVS syllabus, include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Regulation of access to biological resources:</strong> The NBA regulates access by <em>foreign individuals, companies 
          or organisations</em> to India’s biological resources and associated traditional knowledge. Prior approval of NBA is required 
          for research, commercial utilisation, bio-survey, bio-utilisation or for applying for intellectual property rights (IPRs) abroad 
          based on Indian biological material.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Benefit-sharing arrangements:</strong> The Authority decides the terms and conditions for <strong>fair and equitable 
          sharing of benefits</strong> arising out of the use of India’s biological resources and traditional knowledge. Benefits may be 
          monetary (royalties, fees) or non-monetary (technology transfer, training, support to local communities).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advisory role to the Central Government:</strong> NBA advises the Central Government on conservation of biodiversity, 
          sustainable use of its components, and on matters relating to access and benefit sharing, including policy measures and 
          international negotiations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Support and guidance to State Biodiversity Boards (SBBs):</strong> It lays down guidelines for constitution and 
          functioning of State Biodiversity Boards and <strong>Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs)</strong> at local body level.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protection of traditional knowledge:</strong> NBA is involved in measures to protect the rights of local and indigenous 
          communities over their knowledge and to prevent misappropriation (“bio-piracy”) through unethical patents.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>NBA within the three-tier biodiversity governance system</h2>
      <p>
        The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 establishes a <strong>three-tier system</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>National level:</strong> National Biodiversity Authority (NBA).</li>
        <li><strong>State level:</strong> State Biodiversity Boards (SBBs) in each State/UT.</li>
        <li><strong>Local level:</strong> Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) at village panchayats, municipalities and other local bodies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this system, NBA acts as the apex body setting <strong>overall policy and regulatory framework</strong>, while SBBs and BMCs 
        implement activities at the state and local levels. This structure ensures that biodiversity governance is both <strong>centralised 
        for national interests</strong> and <strong>decentralised for local participation</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Importance of NBA for biodiversity conservation and national sovereignty</h2>
      <p>
        The existence of the National Biodiversity Authority has several important implications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It helps India to <strong>assert its sovereign rights</strong> over biological resources and associated knowledge, especially when 
          dealing with multinational corporations and foreign research institutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          It provides a legal mechanism to <strong>prevent bio-piracy</strong>, such as unauthorised patents on plant varieties, medicinal plants 
          or traditional formulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          It ensures that local communities, who have conserved biodiversity for generations, receive a <strong>fair share of benefits</strong> 
          when their resources or knowledge are commercially used.
        </li>
        <li>
          It guides the government in integrating biodiversity concerns into sectors such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, industry and trade.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exam-oriented recap</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, the body created at national level is the <strong>National Biodiversity Authority (NBA)</strong>.</li>
        <li>NBA is a statutory, autonomous apex body with headquarters at Chennai.</li>
        <li>Main roles: regulate access to biological resources, decide benefit-sharing, advise Central Government, support SBBs and BMCs, and prevent bio-piracy.</li>
        <li>It is part of a three-tier system: NBA (national), SBBs (state) and BMCs (local).</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The blank in the statement is filled by the <strong>National Biodiversity Authority (NBA)</strong>. 
        As the apex body created under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, the NBA plays a central role in regulating access to India’s 
        biological resources, ensuring fair benefit-sharing and safeguarding our rich biodiversity and traditional knowledge for present as 
        well as future generations.

      This answer forms part of a carefully curated set of important questions that have frequently appeared in
      past university examinations and therefore hold a high probability of reappearing in future assessments.
      While prepared with academic accuracy and aligned to the prescribed syllabus, these solutions should be
      treated as high-quality preparation material rather than a guaranteed prediction of any upcoming exam paper.
