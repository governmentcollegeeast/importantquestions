      Short Note (a). What is Goal 15?
      <span style="color:var(--muted);">(Answer framed approximately for 10 marks)</span>
    </p>

    <article>
      <p><strong>Introduction.</strong> In 2015, the United Nations adopted a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to guide global development up to the year 2030. These goals integrate three pillars of sustainability – economic growth, social justice and environmental protection. Among them, <strong>Goal 15, titled “Life on Land”</strong>, is directly concerned with the conservation and sustainable management of the earth’s terrestrial ecosystems. It is extremely relevant to Environmental Studies because it deals with forests, soils, wildlife, biodiversity and land resources on which human survival ultimately depends.</p>

      <h2>Exact idea and title of Goal 15</h2>
      <p>
        Goal 15 is known as <strong>“Life on Land”</strong>. Its broad objective is to <em>“protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.”</em>  
        Thus, Goal 15 does not merely talk about protecting nature in a narrow sense; it emphasises that land, forests and biodiversity must be used wisely, restored wherever damaged and passed on to future generations in a healthy condition.
      </p>

      <h2>Major components / targets of Goal 15</h2>
      <p>Goal 15 has several specific targets. For exam purposes, they can be grouped under the following heads:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>(i) Protection and restoration of ecosystems:</strong> Conserve and restore forests, mountains, drylands, wetlands and inland freshwater ecosystems. This includes preventing their degradation and promoting scientific management.</li>
        <li><strong>(ii) Sustainable forest management:</strong> Reduce deforestation, forest degradation, forest fires and illegal logging. Encourage afforestation and reforestation and recognise the role of local communities in protecting forests.</li>
        <li><strong>(iii) Combating desertification and land degradation:</strong> Take effective steps to prevent land from turning into desert due to overgrazing, deforestation, faulty agricultural practices, mining and climate change. The aim is to achieve “land degradation neutrality”, where any loss of productive land is balanced by restoration.</li>
        <li><strong>(iv) Conservation of biodiversity:</strong> Protect threatened and endangered species, conserve genetic diversity and prevent extinction. The goal supports creation and strengthening of protected areas such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and biosphere reserves.</li>
        <li><strong>(v) Control of poaching and illegal wildlife trade:</strong> Curb hunting, poaching and trafficking of animals, birds and plants, which are major causes of biodiversity loss.</li>
        <li><strong>(vi) Fair sharing of benefits:</strong> Ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilisation of genetic resources and traditional knowledge, especially with local and indigenous communities who have protected biodiversity for generations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Environmental and developmental significance</h2>
      <p>
        Goal 15 is significant because terrestrial ecosystems provide a wide variety of <strong>ecological services</strong>: they regulate climate, maintain the water cycle, control floods and droughts, conserve soil, and act as carbon sinks. Forests and fertile soils support agriculture and food security, provide timber, fuelwood, fibres, medicines and a large number of non-timber forest products. Biodiversity ensures ecological balance and resilience of ecosystems.
      </p>
      <p>
        When forests are cleared, wetlands drained and soils eroded, the immediate result is loss of habitat for wildlife, reduction in biodiversity and decline in soil fertility. In the long run, such degradation leads to increased natural disasters, climate change, rural poverty and displacement of communities. Therefore, Goal 15 is not only an environmental goal but also a <strong>developmental goal</strong>, closely linked with poverty reduction, food security and human well-being.
      </p>

      <h2>Relevance of Goal 15 for India</h2>
      <p>
        For a country like India, Goal 15 has special importance. India possesses diverse terrestrial ecosystems – the Himalayan forests, the Western Ghats, the Thar desert, fertile river plains and coastal regions. At the same time, our land resources are under tremendous pressure due to high population density, urbanisation, industrialisation, intensive agriculture and infrastructure projects. Problems such as deforestation, soil erosion, salinisation, waterlogging, shifting cultivation and unplanned mining are widespread.
      </p>
      <p>
        Achieving Goal 15 in the Indian context means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conserving and expanding forest cover, especially in ecologically sensitive areas.</li>
        <li>Adopting soil and water conservation measures to check land degradation and desertification.</li>
        <li>Strengthening protected area networks and corridors for wildlife movement.</li>
        <li>Implementing laws such as the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 and the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 in letter and spirit.</li>
        <li>Involving local communities, panchayats and indigenous groups in the planning and management of land and forest resources.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exam-oriented recap (points to write)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Goal 15 is one of the 17 SDGs; its title is <strong>“Life on Land”</strong>.</li>
        <li>Main aim: protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, manage forests sustainably, combat desertification, halt land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.</li>
        <li>Covers forests, soils, land resources, biodiversity, wildlife protection and benefit sharing with local communities.</li>
        <li>Environmentally important because healthy land ecosystems support climate regulation, food security, water conservation and ecological balance.</li>
        <li>Particularly relevant to India due to high dependence of rural population on land and forests and increasing pressure on terrestrial resources.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> To sum up, Goal 15 (“Life on Land”) is a comprehensive global commitment to safeguard forests, soils, biodiversity and terrestrial ecosystems. It reminds all countries that genuine development must be based on the sustainable use and careful restoration of land resources, so that the ecological foundations of human life remain strong for present as well as future generations.

      This answer forms part of a carefully curated set of important questions that have frequently appeared in
      past university examinations and therefore hold a high probability of reappearing in future assessments.
      While prepared with academic accuracy and aligned to the prescribed syllabus, these solutions should be
      treated as high-quality preparation material rather than a guaranteed prediction of any upcoming exam paper.
