Q17. What do you mean by attitude? How can attitude be measured?
</p>

<article>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> In organisational behaviour, the concept of <strong>attitude</strong> occupies a central place because it strongly influences how people think, feel and behave at work. Whether an employee co-operates with colleagues, accepts change, deals politely with customers or resists authority depends largely upon his attitudes towards <strong>work, boss, co-workers, organisation and self</strong>. Managers are therefore interested not only in understanding what attitudes are but also in <strong>measuring</strong> them so that favourable attitudes may be strengthened and unfavourable ones may be changed. The present answer explains the <strong>meaning and nature of attitude</strong> and then describes the main <strong>methods of measuring attitude</strong> used in managerial practice.</p>

<h2>Meaning of Attitude</h2>
<p>In simple words, <strong>attitude may be defined as a learned predisposition of an individual to think, feel and behave in a particular way towards a given object, person or situation.</strong> It is an internal state which expresses whether a person likes or dislikes something.</p>

<p>Important elements of this meaning are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is a <strong>predisposition</strong> – a readiness to respond in a particular manner, not the actual behaviour itself.</li>
  <li>It is always directed towards some <strong>object, person, group or issue</strong> (for example, attitude towards supervisor, towards safety rules, towards trade union, etc.).</li>
  <li>It is <strong>learned</strong> through experience, interaction and socialisation; it is not inborn.</li>
  <li>It has a <strong>favourable or unfavourable direction</strong> (positive, negative or neutral).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Components of Attitude (ABC Model)</h2>
<p>Most psychologists describe attitude as consisting of three inter-related components, often called the <strong>ABC components</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>(A) Affective component:</strong> This refers to the <strong>feelings or emotions</strong> associated with an object – liking, disliking, respect, anger, fear, etc. Example: “I feel happy while working in this organisation.”</li>
  <li><strong>(B) Behavioural component:</strong> This is the <strong>tendency to act</strong> or behave in a certain way towards the attitude object. Example: “I come regularly, work sincerely and recommend this organisation to others.”</li>
  <li><strong>(C) Cognitive component:</strong> This refers to the <strong>beliefs, ideas or knowledge</strong> that a person has about the object. Example: “This organisation provides good opportunities for growth and fair promotion policy.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, attitude is a <strong>combination of belief, feeling and action tendency</strong> regarding a particular object.</p>

<h2>Nature / Characteristics of Attitude</h2>
<p>From the above discussion, main characteristics of attitude may be summarised as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1. Learned and acquired:</strong> Attitudes are not inherited; they are acquired from family, school, peer group, culture, media and work experiences.</li>
  <li><strong>2. Relatively stable but changeable:</strong> Attitudes are fairly stable over time, yet they can be changed through new information, strong experiences, training and counselling.</li>
  <li><strong>3. Have direction and intensity:</strong> Attitude indicates whether a person is <strong>for or against</strong> something (direction) and how strongly he holds that feeling (intensity).</li>
  <li><strong>4. Object-related:</strong> Every attitude has a specific focus – e.g., attitude towards job, towards supervisor, towards safety rules, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>5. Influences behaviour:</strong> Attitude does not always determine behaviour perfectly, but it has a strong influence. Favourable attitude is likely to result in supportive behaviour and vice versa.</li>
  <li><strong>6. Can be measured:</strong> Though attitudes are internal, they can be <strong>measured indirectly</strong> through carefully designed psychological tools, which is essential for managerial decisions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Need for Measuring Attitude</h2>
<p>In organisational setting, measurement of attitude is important because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It helps to <strong>diagnose the overall climate</strong> of the organisation – whether employees think positively or negatively about various policies.</li>
  <li>It helps to identify <strong>specific areas of dissatisfaction</strong> such as pay, promotion, supervision or working conditions.</li>
  <li>It assists in evaluating the effect of <strong>new schemes and changes</strong> (introduction of incentive plan, job enrichment, training programmes, etc.).</li>
  <li>It guides managers in <strong>designing appropriate strategies</strong> for attitude improvement and change.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methods of Measuring Attitude</h2>
<p>Since attitude is a psychological state, it cannot be observed directly. It is therefore measured indirectly by examining what people <strong>say</strong>, how they <strong>act</strong> and, in some cases, how their <strong>body responds</strong>. The main methods are discussed below.</p>

<h3>I. Self-Report / Questionnaire Methods</h3>
<p>These are the most widely used methods in organisations. Individuals are asked to express their degree of agreement or disagreement with a series of statements. Their responses are scored to indicate attitude.</p>

<h3>1. Single-Item Global Rating</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The simplest method asks the respondent to answer a single question such as: <em>“Overall, how satisfied are you with your job?”</em></li>
  <li>Responses may be on a five-point or seven-point scale: <em>Very satisfied – Satisfied – Neutral – Dissatisfied – Very dissatisfied</em>.</li>
  <li>This gives a quick overall measure of attitude but does not reveal reasons behind it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Likert’s Summated Rating Scale</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Developed by Rensis Likert, this is one of the most popular methods of attitude measurement.</li>
  <li>A large number of statements relating to the attitude object are prepared. Example (attitude towards job): “My job is interesting”; “My supervisor treats me fairly”; “Promotions are based on merit”, etc.</li>
  <li>For each statement, the respondent indicates his degree of agreement on a scale such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Strongly agree (5)</li>
      <li>Agree (4)</li>
      <li>Undecided (3)</li>
      <li>Disagree (2)</li>
      <li>Strongly disagree (1)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scores of all items are added to obtain a <strong>total attitude score</strong>. High score indicates favourable attitude and low score indicates unfavourable attitude.</li>
  <li>Likert scales are easy to construct, simple to administer and suitable for large groups, therefore widely used in organisational surveys.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Thurstone’s Equal-Appearing Interval Scale</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This method involves preparing a large number of attitude statements and getting them judged by experts, who rate each statement on a scale from extremely favourable to extremely unfavourable.</li>
  <li>Statements representing various points on the favourability continuum are selected. Respondents are asked to indicate which statements they agree with.</li>
  <li>An average scale value of agreed statements represents the respondent’s attitude score.</li>
  <li>Though more scientific, this method is <strong>time-consuming</strong> and therefore less commonly used in routine organisational work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Semantic Differential Scale</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Developed by Osgood and colleagues, this method measures the <strong>meaning</strong> that an individual gives to a concept by using pairs of opposite adjectives.</li>
  <li>For example, to measure attitude towards “my job”, bipolar adjective pairs may be:
    <ul>
      <li>Good &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Bad</li>
      <li>Interesting &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Boring</li>
      <li>Important &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Unimportant</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Between each pair, seven (or five) positions are marked. The respondent marks the point that best expresses his feeling.</li>
  <li>Scores on all items are combined to provide an attitude profile. This method gives a <strong>rich picture of the emotional meaning</strong> attached to the object.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Bogardus Social Distance Scale (mainly for social attitudes)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This scale measures the degree of acceptance or rejection of various social groups.</li>
  <li>Though more often used in social psychology (e.g., measuring prejudice), the idea can be used in organisations to study attitudes towards different categories of employees.</li>
</ul>

<h3>II. Observation and Behavioural Measures</h3>
<p>Sometimes attitudes are inferred from how people actually behave in real situations rather than from what they say.</p>

<h3>6. Systematic Observation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Supervisors observe employees’ <strong>day-to-day behaviour</strong> – punctuality, co-operation, willingness to accept extra work, participation in meetings, etc.</li>
  <li>Repeated observation over a period of time can give a reasonably accurate idea of the person’s attitude towards work, organisation or supervisor.</li>
  <li>However, observation may be affected by <strong>bias of the observer</strong> and therefore should be used carefully.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Behavioural Indicators from Records</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Certain organisational records serve as indirect indicators of attitudes, e.g.:
    <ul>
      <li>Rates of voluntary absenteeism and labour turnover,</li>
      <li>Number of grievances and disciplinary cases,</li>
      <li>Participation in voluntary activities and suggestion schemes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>While these do not measure attitude directly, patterns in such data may suggest favourable or unfavourable attitudes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>III. Interview and Projective Methods</h3>

<h3>8. Structured and Unstructured Interviews</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Employees may be interviewed individually or in groups about their feelings and opinions regarding the job, supervisor, company policies, etc.</li>
  <li>Interviews allow probing of reasons behind certain attitudes and are especially useful when <strong>complex issues</strong> are involved.</li>
  <li>However, they are time-consuming and may be influenced by the skill and biases of the interviewer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9. Projective Techniques</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In projective methods, individuals are asked to <strong>interpret ambiguous stimuli</strong> such as pictures, incomplete sentences or stories.</li>
  <li>Examples are Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), sentence-completion test, word-association test, etc.</li>
  <li>Their responses are analysed to uncover <strong>hidden motives and deep-seated attitudes</strong>.</li>
  <li>These techniques are mainly used in clinical and research settings rather than in routine organisational surveys because they require <strong>expert administration and interpretation</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>IV. Physiological Measures (Brief Note)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In some research situations, attitudes are inferred from <strong>physiological responses</strong> like heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response, etc., recorded while a person is exposed to particular stimuli.</li>
  <li>These measures are useful for exploring emotional aspects but they are <strong>costly and not practical</strong> for normal organisational diagnosis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Essential Requirements of a Good Attitude Measurement</h2>
<p>Whatever method is used, measurement of attitude should satisfy the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> The method should give consistent results if repeated.</li>
  <li><strong>Validity:</strong> It should actually measure attitude and not something else (for example, social desirability or temporary mood).</li>
  <li><strong>Simplicity and clarity:</strong> Statements and questions should be easy to understand.</li>
  <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Respondents must feel safe that their answers will not be misused; otherwise they may not respond honestly.</li>
  <li><strong>Usefulness:</strong> Results should be analysed and fed back for <strong>improving policies and practices</strong>; otherwise employees lose faith in surveys.</li>
</ul>

<p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion.</strong> To conclude, <strong>attitude</strong> is a learned predisposition of an individual to think, feel and act in a favourable or unfavourable manner towards a particular object, person or situation. It has cognitive, affective and behavioural components and plays a crucial role in shaping work behaviour in organisations. Since attitudes cannot be observed directly, they are measured indirectly through <strong>self-report scales (Likert, Thurstone, semantic differential, etc.), interviews, observation, behavioural indicators, projective techniques and, in specialised studies, physiological measures</strong>. For managers, systematic measurement of attitude is essential for diagnosing organisational climate, identifying sources of dissatisfaction and designing appropriate programmes for attitude development and change.</p>

  This answer forms part of a carefully curated set of important questions that have frequently appeared in
  past university examinations and therefore hold a high probability of reappearing in future assessments.
  While prepared with academic accuracy and aligned with the standard B.Com (Sem I) syllabus of <em>Psychology for
  Managers</em> (Kalyani Publications — Shashi K. Gupta &amp; Rosy Joshi), these notes should be treated as
  high-quality preparation material rather than a guaranteed prediction of any upcoming exam paper.
