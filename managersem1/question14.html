Q14. How does selectivity affect perception? Give examples to show how selectivity can create perceptual distortions.
</p>

<article>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> In any organisational situation, a person is continuously bombarded with a large number of stimuli – sounds, sights, messages, behaviours of others, notices, circulars, phone calls, etc. The human mind cannot attend to and interpret all these stimuli at the same time. Therefore, every individual engages in <strong>selective perception</strong> – he selects certain stimuli for attention, organises them and interprets them according to his own psychological framework. Selectivity is necessary for survival, but it also becomes a major source of <strong>perceptual distortion</strong>. Managers must understand how selectivity operates and how it may lead to wrong judgements about people and events.</p>

<h2>Meaning of Selective Perception</h2>
<p><strong>Selective perception</strong> refers to the tendency of individuals to <strong>select only a part of the available sensory information</strong> and to ignore the rest, and then to interpret the selected information in line with their needs, motives, expectations and attitudes.</p>

<p>Thus, perception is not a mirror of reality; it is a <strong>filtered and edited version</strong> of reality. Two persons may face the same situation but perceive it differently because they <strong>select different cues</strong> and attach different meanings to them.</p>

<h2>Why is Perception Selective?</h2>
<p>Selectivity arises mainly due to two reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Limited capacity of attention:</strong> At a time we can attend consciously to only a small portion of the stimuli present in the environment. Therefore we must select.</li>
  <li><strong>Psychological filters:</strong> Our motives, interests, experience, attitudes and expectations act as filters. We tend to notice information that is <strong>important, interesting, threatening or consistent</strong> with our beliefs and ignore the rest.</li>
</ul>

<p>This selection process operates at all three stages of perception:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Selective attention</strong> – which stimuli we notice,</li>
  <li><strong>Selective organisation</strong> – how we group and arrange the noticed stimuli,</li>
  <li><strong>Selective interpretation</strong> – what meaning we give to the organised stimuli.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Determinants of Selectivity</h2>
<p>Selectivity is influenced by factors related to the <strong>perceiver</strong>, the <strong>stimulus</strong> and the <strong>situation</strong>.</p>

<h3>1. Factors in the Perceiver</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Needs and motives:</strong> A person who is hungry selectively notices food-related cues; a worker seeking promotion notices indications of career opportunities.</li>
  <li><strong>Interests:</strong> An engineer may pay more attention to technical details; a finance officer focuses on costs and profits.</li>
  <li><strong>Attitudes and values:</strong> A manager who believes that “workers are irresponsible” tends to notice behaviour that supports this belief and ignores behaviour that contradicts it.</li>
  <li><strong>Expectations:</strong> People tend to see what they <strong>expect</strong> to see. Expectations create a “perceptual set” which guides selection and interpretation.</li>
  <li><strong>Past experience:</strong> Previous experiences create habits of attention; stimuli similar to past experiences are easily noticed and interpreted in the same way.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Factors in the Stimulus (Object)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Intensity and size:</strong> Loud sounds, bright colours, big headlines or large offices are more likely to be noticed.</li>
  <li><strong>Novelty and contrast:</strong> Unusual, unexpected and contrasting events automatically attract attention – e.g., a worker who never takes leave suddenly remains absent; a very young supervisor in a group of older workers, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Repetition and movement:</strong> Repeated messages and moving objects also receive selective attention.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Factors in the Situation</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Time and place:</strong> What we focus on depends on the time of the event (beginning or end of the shift, crisis or routine period) and on the setting (office, shop floor, canteen).</li>
  <li><strong>Social context:</strong> Presence of other people and group norms guide what we attend to and how we interpret it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Selectivity as a Source of Perceptual Distortion</h2>
<p>Because perception is selective, our view of reality is often <strong>partial and biased</strong>. Following are some important ways in which selectivity leads to distortions, with managerial examples.</p>

<h3>1. Stereotyping</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Stereotyping means judging an individual on the basis of the group to which he is perceived to belong, instead of on the basis of his own characteristics.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We selectively perceive information that <strong>supports</strong> our stereotype (e.g., “women are emotional”, “young people are irresponsible”) and ignore information that <strong>contradicts</strong> it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A manager believes that “rural employees are conservative”. When a village-based worker suggests an innovative idea, the manager may ignore it or treat it as a chance event, while he quickly notices and praises similar suggestions by urban employees. This selective perception reinforces his stereotype and results in unfair treatment.</p>

<h3>2. Halo and Horn Effect</h3>
<p><strong>Halo effect:</strong> Forming an overall favourable impression on the basis of one good trait and then selectively perceiving only positive information.</p>
<p><strong>Horn effect:</strong> Forming an overall negative impression on the basis of one undesirable trait and then noticing only negative aspects.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A supervisor is impressed by one subordinate’s fluency in English. Because of this halo, he selectively notices this subordinate’s few successes and overlooks his frequent delay in completing tasks. Another subordinate who once committed a serious mistake is viewed through the “horn” and is evaluated harshly even when his current performance is satisfactory.</p>

<h3>3. Selective Attention to Favourable or Threatening Information</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Individuals tend to notice information which supports their <strong>self-image</strong> and to avoid information which threatens it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A production manager strongly believes that “machine breakdowns are the main cause of low output”. During review meetings he listens carefully to data about breakdown time but pays little attention to reports on absenteeism or poor planning. As a result, he underestimates the role of human factors and continues to blame only machines, leading to wrong decisions.</p>

<h3>4. First Impression and Primacy Effect</h3>
<p>Initial information about a person or event often receives <strong>disproportionately high weight</strong>. Later behaviour is selectively interpreted to fit the first impression.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> On the first day, a new employee appears nervous and gives a confused answer. The supervisor forms an impression that the employee is “slow and dull”. Afterwards, even when the employee performs well, the supervisor selectively remembers only those incidents which confirm the first impression and ignores contrary evidence.</p>

<h3>5. Recency Effect</h3>
<p>Sometimes, instead of the first impression, very <strong>recent events</strong> receive selective attention, especially when the rater does not maintain systematic records.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> During the annual appraisal, a supervisor is strongly influenced by a subordinate’s excellent performance in the last month and forgets his average performance during the earlier eleven months. Thus, selective recall of recent behaviour distorts the overall evaluation.</p>

<h3>6. Projection</h3>
<p><strong>Projection</strong> means attributing one’s own feelings, motives or characteristics to others. Here selectivity operates by making us notice in others what is <strong>present in ourselves</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A manager who himself frequently comes late to office may believe that “everyone gets delayed due to traffic” and thus tends to ignore or underestimate subordinates’ latecoming. Conversely, a very hardworking manager may project his own work orientation and judge others harshly if they do not show the same level of devotion.</p>

<h3>7. Selective Perception in Communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In communication, receivers selectively hear parts of a message which match their interests and ignore the rest, leading to misunderstanding.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Management announces a new incentive scheme along with a revision in work standards. Workers may selectively attend to the increased norms and ignore the potential benefits, perceiving the change as exploitation. On the other hand, some workers may hear only about the incentives and later feel deceived when they realise that standards have also been tightened.</p>

<h3>8. Self-Fulfilling Prophecy (Pygmalion Effect)</h3>
<p>Selective perception of a manager may actually <strong>shape the behaviour of subordinates</strong> in such a way that it confirms the manager’s expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If a manager believes that a particular worker is very capable, he gives him important assignments, provides guidance and shows confidence in him. The worker responds by performing well, confirming the manager’s favourable perception. Conversely, a worker labelled as “incapable” may be given only routine work and little support; he may gradually lose confidence and actually perform poorly. Thus, selective perception creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<h2>Managerial Implications of Selective Perception</h2>
<p>Selective perception has serious implications for managerial behaviour and organisational effectiveness:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance appraisal:</strong> Ratings may become unfair if managers selectively remember only some incidents or judge on the basis of stereotypes, halo, primacy and recency effects.</li>
  <li><strong>Motivation and morale:</strong> When employees feel that they are being misjudged due to biased perception, their motivation and loyalty decline.</li>
  <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Leaders may misread the abilities and intentions of followers, leading to inappropriate style – too much control over capable people or too much freedom for unprepared people.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Messages may be misinterpreted due to selective listening. The same decision may be perceived differently by different groups.</li>
  <li><strong>Conflict:</strong> Many conflicts arise not from objective clashes of interest but from <strong>distorted perceptions</strong> about each other’s motives and behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Measures to Reduce Harmful Effects of Selectivity (Brief)</h2>
<p>Although selectivity cannot be eliminated, its negative effects can be minimised by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating <strong>self-awareness</strong> among managers about their own biases and perceptual tendencies.</li>
  <li>Collecting information from <strong>multiple sources</strong> and not relying on isolated observations.</li>
  <li>Using <strong>clear, job-related criteria</strong> for evaluation instead of vague impressions.</li>
  <li>Encouraging <strong>open communication</strong> and feedback so that misperceptions can be corrected.</li>
  <li>Providing <strong>training programmes</strong> in perception, communication and interpersonal skills.</li>
</ul>

<p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion.</strong> To conclude, selectivity is an essential feature of human perception arising from limited attentional capacity and psychological filters such as needs, attitudes, interests, expectations and past experiences. It determines what aspects of the environment we notice, how we organise them and what meaning we attach to them. However, the same selectivity that helps us cope with complexity also creates <strong>perceptual distortions</strong> such as stereotyping, halo and horn effect, primacy and recency effects, projection, biased listening and self-fulfilling prophecies. In organisational life, these distortions may lead to unfair appraisals, poor communication, low morale and unnecessary conflict. A wise manager, therefore, consciously examines his own perceptions, seeks additional evidence, encourages feedback and designs systems that reduce the scope for bias. In this way, selective perception can be controlled and perception can move closer to <strong>reality and fairness</strong>, which is essential for sound managerial decisions and healthy human relations in the organisation.</p>
