<p class="question">Q21. What is communication? Explain its meaning, process and main types. Discuss the barriers to effective communication and suggest measures to overcome these barriers in an organisation.</p>

<article>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> In modern organisations, work is performed through <strong>people working together in groups and departments</strong>. For coordination of their efforts, sharing of information, issuing of instructions, taking feedback and building relationships, an effective system of <strong>communication</strong> is absolutely essential. A manager spends a large part of his time in communicating – writing, talking, listening, meeting, telephoning, using electronic media and so on. In Psychology for Managers, communication is studied not merely as a transmission of messages, but as a <strong>psychological and social process</strong> that influences attitudes, motivation, morale and organisational climate. Poor communication is often at the root of misunderstandings, conflicts, delays and resistance to change. Therefore, a clear understanding of the meaning, process, types, barriers and remedies is indispensable for every manager.</p>

<h2>Meaning and Definition of Communication</h2>
<p>The word <strong>communication</strong> is derived from the Latin term “<em>communis</em>” which means “<em>common</em>”. The basic idea is to create a <strong>common understanding</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Simple meaning:</strong> Communication is the process of <strong>exchanging information and understanding</strong> between two or more persons through a common system of symbols, signs or behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>Exam-oriented definition:</strong> Communication may be defined as the <strong>process by which a message is transmitted and understood between a sender and a receiver</strong>. It involves transmission of facts, ideas, opinions, emotions and attitudes, with the purpose of creating a common understanding and acting upon it.</p>

<p>Thus, communication is not complete merely when a message is sent; it is complete only when the message is <strong>received, properly understood and acted upon</strong> by the receiver.</p>

<h2>Nature / Characteristics of Communication</h2>
<p>The main characteristics of communication from the managerial and psychological point of view are:</p>

<h3>1. Communication is a Two-Way Process</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Communication always involves at least two parties – a <strong>sender</strong> and a <strong>receiver</strong>.</li>
  <li>It is not a one-sided act of giving instructions; effective communication includes <strong>feedback</strong> from the receiver back to the sender.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Communication Involves Exchange of Meaning, Not Just Transmission of Words</h3>
<ul>
  <li>True communication occurs when the <strong>meaning intended by the sender is understood in the same sense</strong> by the receiver.</li>
  <li>Mere transmission of words or symbols is not sufficient; the psychological understanding is crucial.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Communication is a Continuous and Pervasive Activity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Communication takes place at all levels of the organisation, all the time – vertically, horizontally and informally.</li>
  <li>Managers cannot “avoid” communicating; even their <strong>silence, facial expressions and actions</strong> also communicate something.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Communication has Both Formal and Informal Dimensions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It takes place through <strong>formal channels</strong> prescribed by organisational structure (e.g., official memos, circulars, meetings).</li>
  <li>It also takes place through <strong>informal channels</strong> (grapevine, casual talks), which play an important role in shaping attitudes and morale.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Communication is a Social and Psychological Process</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Communication is influenced by <strong>perception, attitudes, emotions, social relations and culture</strong>.</li>
  <li>People interpret messages differently depending on their past experiences, values and expectations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Communication is the Lifeblood of an Organisation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Planning, coordinating, directing, motivating and controlling – all managerial functions depend on effective communication.</li>
  <li>Without communication, an organisation would be like a body without a nervous system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Process of Communication</h2>
<p>The communication process can be explained through the following important elements or steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sender (communicator)</li>
  <li>Message</li>
  <li>Encoding</li>
  <li>Channel (medium)</li>
  <li>Receiver</li>
  <li>Decoding</li>
  <li>Feedback</li>
  <li>Noise</li>
</ol>

<h3>1. Sender</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The process begins with the <strong>sender</strong>, who has some idea, information, feeling or intention to communicate.</li>
  <li>Example: A manager who wants to issue an instruction, give information, or seek a report.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Message</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>message</strong> is the actual content to be conveyed – facts, ideas, opinions, emotions, orders, suggestions etc.</li>
  <li>The sender must be clear about the objective and content of the message.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Encoding</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Encoding</strong> means <strong>converting the idea into symbols</strong> which can be transmitted and understood, such as words, gestures, diagrams, numbers, pictures.</li>
  <li>The choice of language, tone and style of expression is part of encoding.</li>
  <li>Effective encoding requires understanding of the receiver’s background, language and level of knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Channel (Medium)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>channel</strong> is the medium through which the message is transmitted from sender to receiver.</li>
  <li>It may be oral (face-to-face talk, telephone), written (letters, circulars, emails, reports), or non-verbal (body language, gestures, facial expressions).</li>
  <li>The choice of channel depends on the nature of message, urgency, need for record and distance between parties.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Receiver</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>receiver</strong> is the person or group for whom the message is intended.</li>
  <li>Receiver’s attitudes, knowledge, assumptions, and relationship with sender influence how the message is interpreted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Decoding</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Decoding</strong> is the process by which the receiver <strong>interprets and understands</strong> the message.</li>
  <li>If the receiver attaches the same meaning to the message as intended by the sender, communication is effective.</li>
  <li>Misinterpretation during decoding leads to misunderstanding.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Feedback</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Feedback</strong> is the response of the receiver back to the sender – it may be in words, actions or silence.</li>
  <li>Feedback tells the sender whether the message has been understood correctly and whether any action has been taken.</li>
  <li>It makes communication truly <strong>two-way</strong> and helps in correcting distortions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Noise</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Noise</strong> refers to any disturbance, interference or distortion in the communication process which <strong>hampers transmission or understanding</strong> of the message.</li>
  <li>It may be physical (loud sounds, poor connection), semantic (ambiguous words), psychological (prejudices, emotions) or organisational (too many levels).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, communication is a cyclic process: <em>Sender → Message → Encoding → Channel → Receiver → Decoding → Feedback</em>, with “noise” potentially disturbing at any point.</p>

<h2>Types of Communication in Organisations</h2>
<p>Communication in organisations may be classified in several ways. For B.Com (Sem I) level, the following classifications are important:</p>

<h3>I. On the Basis of Direction in the Organisation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Downward communication</li>
  <li>Upward communication</li>
  <li>Horizontal (lateral) communication</li>
  <li>Diagonal communication</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Downward Communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Flow of information from <strong>higher level to lower level</strong> in the organisational hierarchy.</li>
  <li>Includes instructions, orders, rules, policies, feedback on performance and organisational news.</li>
  <li>Helps in explaining organisational goals, assigning tasks and maintaining control.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Upward Communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Flow of information from <strong>subordinates to superiors</strong>.</li>
  <li>Includes reports on performance, suggestions, complaints, grievances, reactions and requests.</li>
  <li>Essential for feedback, decision-making and understanding employee attitudes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Horizontal (Lateral) Communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Communication among people at the <strong>same level</strong> in the hierarchy – for example, between managers of different departments, or among colleagues.</li>
  <li>Used for coordination of activities, sharing of information and teamwork.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Diagonal Communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Communication that <strong>cuts across formal lines</strong> of authority and responsibility.</li>
  <li>Example: A sales executive contacting production supervisor directly regarding delivery schedules.</li>
  <li>Useful for speeding up information flow and coordination.</li>
</ul>

<h3>II. On the Basis of Expression</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Oral communication</li>
  <li>Written communication</li>
  <li>Non-verbal communication</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Oral Communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Communication through spoken words – face-to-face conversations, meetings, telephone calls, presentations.</li>
  <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Quick, flexible, allows immediate feedback, suitable for complex or sensitive matters.</li>
  <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> No permanent record; may be misunderstood if not clear; subject to forgetfulness.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Written Communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Communication through written words – letters, circulars, notices, reports, emails, manuals.</li>
  <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Provides a permanent record; can be carefully prepared; useful for detailed and official information.</li>
  <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Time-consuming; lacks immediate feedback; may be rigid and formal.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Non-Verbal Communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Communication through body language, facial expressions, eye contact, posture, tone of voice, dress, physical distance etc.</li>
  <li>Often called “<strong>silent language</strong>”. It may reinforce or contradict verbal messages.</li>
  <li>Managers must be aware that their non-verbal cues deeply influence employees’ perceptions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>III. Formal and Informal Communication</h3>

<h3>1. Formal Communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Communication which takes place through <strong>officially prescribed channels</strong> of the organisation.</li>
  <li>It is usually documented or traceable and is related to official work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Informal Communication (Grapevine)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Communication that arises out of <strong>social and informal relations</strong> among members of the organisation.</li>
  <li>It is fast and flexible but may carry rumours and half-truths.</li>
  <li>If properly understood, the grapevine can provide useful feedback about morale and attitudes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Barriers to Effective Communication</h2>
<p>In real-life organisations, communication rarely functions perfectly. Various <strong>barriers or obstacles</strong> distort the message or block understanding. Important barriers are:</p>

<h3>1. Semantic Barriers (Language-Related)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>These arise from <strong>problems in the use of language and symbols</strong>.</li>
  <li>Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Use of technical jargon or complex language not understood by receiver.</li>
      <li>Different meanings of the same word for different people.</li>
      <li>Ambiguous or vague expressions such as “soon”, “as early as possible”.</li>
      <li>Poor translation from one language to another.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Psychological / Perceptual Barriers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>These arise from the <strong>attitudes, emotions, perceptions and prejudices</strong> of sender and receiver.</li>
  <li>Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Prejudice against a particular person or group, leading to biased interpretation.</li>
      <li>Ego problems – unwillingness to listen, feeling of superiority or inferiority.</li>
      <li>Emotional states such as anger, anxiety or fear, which block listening.</li>
      <li>Selective perception – people hear only what they want to hear.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Organisational Barriers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>These arise from the <strong>structure and working of the organisation</strong>.</li>
  <li>Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Too many levels of hierarchy leading to delay and distortion of messages.</li>
      <li>Rigid rules and procedures which discourage free flow of information.</li>
      <li>Overload of information – excessive reports, meetings and circulars.</li>
      <li>Inadequate organisational facilities for communication (no proper reporting system, poor record-keeping).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Personal Barriers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>These relate to the personal factors of individuals in the organisation.</li>
  <li>Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of interest in communication on the part of superiors or subordinates.</li>
      <li>Reluctance of subordinates to convey bad news or unfavourable information.</li>
      <li>Differences in status – lower-level employees may feel afraid to express true feelings.</li>
      <li>Poor listening habits – interrupting, jumping to conclusions, not paying attention.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Mechanical / Physical Barriers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>These arise from <strong>defects in physical environment or communication equipment</strong>.</li>
  <li>Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Noise, disturbances, interruption during conversation.</li>
      <li>Defective telephone lines, network failures, poor audio-visual aids.</li>
      <li>Improper seating arrangements in meetings – some people cannot hear or see properly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Cross-Cultural Barriers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In large organisations or multinational companies, differences in <strong>cultural background, values and habits</strong> can create barriers.</li>
  <li>Gestures or words acceptable in one culture may be offensive in another.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Measures to Overcome Barriers and Improve Communication</h2>
<p>Barriers to communication cannot be completely eliminated, but they can be greatly reduced by conscious managerial efforts. Important measures include:</p>

<h3>1. Clarity of Purpose and Message</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The sender must be <strong>clear about the purpose</strong> of communication – what exactly is to be achieved.</li>
  <li>Messages should be <strong>simple, concrete and specific</strong>, avoiding unnecessary technical jargon.</li>
  <li>Use of examples, illustrations and summaries helps understanding.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Knowing the Audience</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The sender should know the <strong>background, education, needs and attitudes</strong> of the receiver.</li>
  <li>Language, level of detail and style should be adapted to the receiver’s capacity and interest.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Use of Proper Channel and Timing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Select the most appropriate <strong>medium</strong> (oral, written, electronic, visual) according to the nature and urgency of the message.</li>
  <li>Important or complex matters may require a combination of channels (e.g., written circular followed by meeting).</li>
  <li>Timing is crucial – communication should be sent at a time when receiver is mentally free and able to respond.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Encouraging Two-Way Communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Managers should actively encourage <strong>questions, feedback and discussion</strong> from subordinates.</li>
  <li>Open-door policies, suggestion schemes and regular meetings help in two-way communication.</li>
  <li>Two-way communication reduces misunderstanding and builds trust.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Developing Good Listening Habits</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Effective communication requires not only good speaking but also <strong>good listening</strong>.</li>
  <li>Managers should listen patiently, avoid interrupting, and give full attention to the speaker.</li>
  <li>Empathetic listening – trying to understand the viewpoint and feelings of the other person – is particularly important.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Simplifying Organisation Structure and Procedures</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid unnecessary levels of hierarchy; <strong>shorter chains of command</strong> reduce distortion and delay.</li>
  <li>Clarify roles, responsibilities and reporting relationships to prevent confusion.</li>
  <li>Standardise procedures for routine reports and information flow.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Creating a Climate of Trust and Openness</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When employees feel that management is <strong>fair, approachable and non-punitive</strong>, they communicate more honestly.</li>
  <li>Leaders should avoid shooting the messenger of bad news, and instead appreciate honesty.</li>
  <li>A climate of trust reduces psychological barriers and encourages free flow of ideas.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Using Proper Aids and Technology</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use modern communication tools – email, intranet, video conferencing – appropriately.</li>
  <li>Ensure that physical facilities (meeting rooms, PA systems, projectors) are in good working condition.</li>
  <li>Visual aids (charts, graphs, slides) make messages clearer and more memorable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9. Training in Communication Skills</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Provide training to managers and employees in <strong>writing skills, presentation skills, listening and interpersonal communication</strong>.</li>
  <li>Role-playing, case studies and workshops help in developing communication competence.</li>
</ul>

<h3>10. Controlling the Grapevine Positively</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Management cannot eliminate informal communication, but it can <strong>reduce harmful rumours</strong> by:
    <ul>
      <li>Providing timely and accurate official information,</li>
      <li>Clarifying doubts promptly,</li>
      <li>Maintaining credibility and consistency in statements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Managerial Importance of Effective Communication</h2>
<p>In the light of the above, the importance of effective communication for managers may be summarised as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is the basis of <strong>planning, directing, coordinating and controlling</strong>.</li>
  <li>It is essential for <strong>motivation, leadership and morale</strong>, because employees respond to what they understand and feel.</li>
  <li>It helps in <strong>conflict resolution and negotiation</strong>.</li>
  <li>It supports organisational change by explaining reasons, benefits and methods of change.</li>
  <li>It builds the organisation’s <strong>internal culture and external image</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> To conclude, communication is the lifeblood of an organisation and a central concern of Psychology for Managers. It is a two-way process of transmitting and understanding messages between sender and receiver, with the objective of creating common understanding and coordinated action. The communication process involves elements such as sender, message, encoding, channel, receiver, decoding, feedback and noise. In organisations, communication flows downward, upward, horizontally and diagonally, and may be oral, written, non-verbal, formal or informal. However, various semantic, psychological, organisational, personal, mechanical and cultural barriers can distort messages and hinder understanding. Effective managers therefore consciously strive to remove these barriers by clarifying messages, choosing suitable channels, encouraging two-way communication, developing listening skills, simplifying structure, building trust and using appropriate technology and training. In this way, communication becomes a powerful instrument for achieving both <strong>organisational efficiency and human satisfaction</strong>.</p>
