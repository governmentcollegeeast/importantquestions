<p class="question">Q10. Explain personality traits that shape the personality of an individual.</p>

<article>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> Personality, as studied in organisational behaviour and psychology for managers, is not only a product of heredity and environment but is also reflected through a number of relatively stable <strong>personality traits</strong>. These traits are enduring characteristics that describe an individual’s typical way of thinking, feeling and behaving in different situations. For a manager, understanding important personality traits is extremely useful because these traits directly influence work behaviour, motivation, leadership, communication, decision-making, conflict handling and response to organisational rules and policies. The same job, under the same conditions, may be handled very differently by two individuals, largely because their personality traits differ.</p>

<h2>Meaning of Personality Traits</h2>
<p>A <strong>trait</strong> may be defined as a relatively permanent and consistent characteristic of an individual which causes him or her to behave in a particular manner across various situations. Examples are sociability, dominance, self-confidence, emotional stability, risk-taking tendency, etc.</p>
<p>Important points regarding traits are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Traits are <strong>relatively stable</strong> over time, though they may slowly develop as the person matures.</li>
  <li>Traits explain why an individual shows <strong>consistency</strong> in behaviour (for example, some people are generally calm, others usually impatient).</li>
  <li>Different traits combine together to form the <strong>total personality pattern</strong> of an individual.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the important personality traits which significantly shape individual behaviour in organisations are explained below.</p>

<h2>I. Introversion–Extroversion</h2>
<p>One of the most basic and widely discussed traits is the continuum from <strong>introversion</strong> to <strong>extroversion</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Extroverts</strong> are outgoing, talkative, sociable and energetic. They enjoy being with people, like to participate in group activities and are generally assertive.</li>
  <li><strong>Introverts</strong> are reserved, quiet, reflective and more inward-looking. They prefer to work alone or in small groups and do not easily open up to strangers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact on behaviour in organisations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Extroverts often perform better in jobs requiring extensive interaction with people, such as sales, public relations and team leadership.</li>
  <li>Introverts may excel in analytical, research-oriented or technical jobs that require concentration and limited social contact.</li>
  <li>Understanding this trait helps managers in <strong>job placement, team composition and communication style</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>II. Locus of Control</h2>
<p><strong>Locus of control</strong> refers to the extent to which individuals believe that they have control over events that affect their lives.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Internal locus of control:</strong> People with an internal locus believe that outcomes are primarily the result of their own effort, ability and decisions. They feel that they can influence what happens to them.</li>
  <li><strong>External locus of control:</strong> People with an external locus believe that outcomes are controlled by external factors such as luck, fate, powerful others or uncontrollable circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact on behaviour in organisations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Individuals with an <strong>internal locus</strong> are generally more proactive, take responsibility for their performance, show higher initiative and are more satisfied with jobs that give them autonomy.</li>
  <li>Individuals with an <strong>external locus</strong> may feel helpless in difficult situations, rely more on guidance, and may be more prone to blame others for failures.</li>
  <li>Managers often prefer <strong>internals</strong> for positions requiring independence, decision-making and leadership.</li>
</ul>

<h2>III. Authoritarianism</h2>
<p><strong>Authoritarianism</strong> is a personality trait that reflects the degree to which an individual believes in and accepts authority and hierarchical power relationships.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An individual with a <strong>high degree of authoritarianism</strong> tends to:
    <ul>
      <li>Accept orders from superiors without question.</li>
      <li>Believe strongly in rules, discipline and status differences.</li>
      <li>Be rigid in opinions and less tolerant of differing viewpoints.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An individual with <strong>low authoritarianism</strong> may:
    <ul>
      <li>Question authority and be more independent in thinking.</li>
      <li>Prefer participative and democratic practices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact on organisational behaviour:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>High authoritarians adjust more easily in bureaucratic organisations with strong hierarchies and strict rules.</li>
  <li>They may, however, be less creative and may not encourage subordinates’ participation.</li>
  <li>Low authoritarians may find rigid structures frustrating but may perform well in flexible, participative and innovative environments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>IV. Machiavellianism</h2>
<p><strong>Machiavellianism</strong> (often called “Mach”) is a trait that indicates the degree to which an individual is pragmatic, emotionally detached and willing to use any means to achieve his or her goals.</p>
<ul>
  <li>High Mach individuals:
    <ul>
      <li>Are manipulative, strategic and focused on self-interest.</li>
      <li>Believe that ends justify the means.</li>
      <li>Are skilled in influencing others and may use flattery, deception or exploitation if necessary.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Low Mach individuals:
    <ul>
      <li>Are more straightforward, value honesty and are less comfortable with manipulation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact on behaviour in organisations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>High Machs may succeed in situations involving bargaining, negotiation or political games, but they may also create distrust and conflict.</li>
  <li>In ethical, value-based organisations, high Mach behaviour is usually discouraged because it can damage team spirit and integrity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>V. Self-Esteem</h2>
<p><strong>Self-esteem</strong> refers to the degree of respect and value that individuals feel about themselves. It indicates how far a person likes or dislikes himself/herself.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Individuals with <strong>high self-esteem</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Have confidence in their abilities.</li>
      <li>Are less sensitive to criticism.</li>
      <li>Set higher goals for themselves and persist in the face of difficulties.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Individuals with <strong>low self-esteem</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Doubt their own worth and capabilities.</li>
      <li>Are more affected by failures and negative feedback.</li>
      <li>May avoid challenges and prefer routine tasks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact on organisational behaviour:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>High self-esteem is usually associated with higher job satisfaction, better performance and greater willingness to accept responsibility.</li>
  <li>Low self-esteem employees may need more support, encouragement and careful feedback to avoid discouragement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>VI. Self-Monitoring</h2>
<p><strong>Self-monitoring</strong> refers to the extent to which individuals observe and regulate their own behaviour to meet the demands of different situations.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>High self-monitors</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Are very sensitive to social cues and expectations.</li>
      <li>Adjust their behaviour and style according to the situation and people around them.</li>
      <li>Are often socially skilled and good at role-playing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Low self-monitors</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Behave more consistently across situations.</li>
      <li>Do not change their behaviour much to please others.</li>
      <li>Are more guided by inner values than by external demands.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact on organisational behaviour:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>High self-monitors may be more successful in jobs that require flexibility, such as public relations, sales and diplomacy, but may sometimes appear less genuine.</li>
  <li>Low self-monitors may be more predictable and sincere, but may find it difficult to adjust to changing expectations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>VII. Risk-Taking Propensity</h2>
<p><strong>Risk-taking propensity</strong> indicates the degree to which an individual is willing to take chances and make decisions in uncertain conditions.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>High risk-takers</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Are comfortable making quick decisions with limited information.</li>
      <li>Prefer challenging and uncertain situations.</li>
      <li>May sometimes make bold and successful moves, but also face the danger of serious mistakes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Low risk-takers</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Prefer stability and clear information.</li>
      <li>Are cautious, analyse more and avoid uncertain situations.</li>
      <li>Generally make fewer mistakes, but may miss good opportunities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact on work behaviour:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>High risk-takers are suitable for jobs such as entrepreneurs, traders, marketing managers and business development roles.</li>
  <li>Low risk-takers may be better in roles requiring accuracy, reliability and careful analysis, such as accounting, quality control and administration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>VIII. Type A and Type B Behaviour Pattern</h2>
<p>The <strong>Type A–Type B behaviour pattern</strong> is another influential trait model that describes how individuals deal with time, work pressure and competition.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Type A individuals</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Are highly ambitious, competitive and achievement-oriented.</li>
      <li>Hate delays, work under constant time pressure and often try to do several things at once.</li>
      <li>Are impatient, easily irritated and may be aggressive.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Type B individuals</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Are more relaxed, patient and easy-going.</li>
      <li>Do not feel excessive time pressure and are less competitive.</li>
      <li>Are able to enjoy leisure and maintain better emotional balance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact on organisational behaviour:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Type A individuals may be highly productive, especially in jobs with tight deadlines, but they are more prone to stress and health problems.</li>
  <li>Type B individuals may handle stress better and maintain long-term stability, though they may not always push themselves aggressively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>IX. Achievement Motivation (Need for Achievement)</h2>
<p>Another important personality trait is the level of <strong>achievement motivation</strong>, that is, the desire to accomplish challenging goals and to excel.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Individuals with <strong>high need for achievement (n-Ach)</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Prefer tasks of moderate difficulty where success depends on their effort.</li>
      <li>Take personal responsibility for results and seek feedback on performance.</li>
      <li>Are often hardworking, persistent and innovative.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Individuals with <strong>low need for achievement</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>May be satisfied with routine tasks and modest goals.</li>
      <li>Do not actively seek responsibility or feedback.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Managerial relevance:</strong> People with high achievement motivation are often suitable for roles requiring initiative, entrepreneurship, sales and managerial positions where performance is individually measurable.</p>

<h2>X. Emotional Stability</h2>
<p><strong>Emotional stability</strong> (opposite of neuroticism) is a key trait that reflects the degree to which a person can remain calm, balanced and free from persistent negative emotions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Emotionally stable individuals:
    <ul>
      <li>Remain calm and composed under pressure.</li>
      <li>Handle criticism and setbacks without overreaction.</li>
      <li>Show consistent and predictable behaviour.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Emotionally unstable individuals:
    <ul>
      <li>Are easily upset, anxious or moody.</li>
      <li>May overreact to minor problems and exhibit frequent emotional swings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Emotional stability is highly valued in managerial and supervisory positions because such individuals can provide confidence and support to others in stressful situations.</p>

<h2>XI. Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness</h2>
<p>Modern personality research often highlights three more broad traits which are also important in organisational life:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Agreeableness:</strong> Tendency to be cooperative, friendly, helpful and trusting. High agreeableness leads to better teamwork and smoother interpersonal relations.</li>
  <li><strong>Conscientiousness:</strong> Degree of organisation, responsibility, reliability and discipline. Highly conscientious people are dependable, careful and achievement-oriented and usually perform better in most jobs.</li>
  <li><strong>Openness to experience:</strong> Tendency to be imaginative, curious, creative and willing to try new things. High openness supports innovation and adaptability to change.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Managerial Implications of Personality Traits</h2>
<p>Understanding personality traits is extremely valuable for managers and future managers because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It helps in <strong>recruitment and selection</strong> by matching personality traits with job requirements.</li>
  <li>It guides <strong>job design and placement</strong> – for example, placing high extroverts in customer-facing roles and highly conscientious individuals in jobs requiring attention to detail.</li>
  <li>It provides clues for <strong>motivating employees</strong> – high achievers respond to challenging goals; high internals prefer autonomy; high self-esteem individuals appreciate recognition.</li>
  <li>It assists in <strong>leadership and communication</strong> by helping managers adapt their style to the personalities of subordinates.</li>
  <li>It improves understanding of <strong>conflict, stress and resistance to change</strong>, enabling managers to handle these problems more effectively.</li>
</ul>

<p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> To conclude, personality traits are enduring characteristics that significantly shape the overall personality and work behaviour of an individual. Traits such as introversion–extroversion, locus of control, authoritarianism, Machiavellianism, self-esteem, self-monitoring, risk-taking, Type A/Type B pattern, achievement motivation, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness provide a useful framework for understanding how and why people differ in organisations. No single trait alone determines behaviour; rather, it is the unique combination of these traits, interacting with the organisational situation, that produces the distinctive personality of each individual. A sound knowledge of these traits equips managers to understand, predict and influence employee behaviour in a more scientific and humane manner.</p>
