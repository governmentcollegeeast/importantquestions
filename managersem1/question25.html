Q25. What do you understand by organisational conflict? Explain its meaning and nature. Discuss the main types and causes of conflict in organisations. What are the consequences of conflict, and how can a manager effectively manage and resolve conflict?
</p>

<article>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> In any organisation, people and groups work together but they do not always think alike or want the same things. They differ in <strong>goals, values, perceptions, interests and personalities</strong>. When such differences become intense and incompatible, they give rise to <strong>conflict</strong>. In earlier classical management thought, conflict was regarded as something purely negative which must be eliminated. Modern behavioural science, however, recognises that conflict is a <strong>natural and inevitable feature</strong> of organisational life. If properly managed, it may even become a <strong>constructive force</strong> leading to better decisions, creativity and change. In “Psychology for Managers” we study conflict as a psychological and social process involving perceptions, emotions and behaviour of individuals and groups.</p>

<h2>Meaning and Definition of Organisational Conflict</h2>
<p><strong>Simple meaning:</strong> Conflict in an organisation means a situation in which <strong>two or more individuals or groups have opposing goals, interests or views and each tries to assert his own position against the other</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Exam-oriented definition:</strong> Organisational conflict may be defined as a <strong>state of opposition or disagreement between individuals or groups in an organisation, arising from differences in goals, perceptions, values, interests or scarce resources, and expressed through attitudes, emotions or behaviour</strong>.</p>

<p>Thus, conflict is more than just difference of opinion. It involves:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Perceived <strong>incompatibility</strong> of interests (“If he gains, I lose”),</li>
  <li>Some degree of <strong>tension or frustration</strong>, and</li>
  <li>Actual or potential <strong>opposing behaviour</strong>, such as arguments, resistance, non-cooperation or bargaining.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Nature / Characteristics of Organisational Conflict</h2>
<p>The main characteristics of conflict, especially in organisational context, are as follows:</p>

<h3>1. Conflict is Inevitable but Not Always Undesirable</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Wherever people work together with <strong>limited resources</strong> and <strong>different goals</strong>, some conflict is bound to occur.</li>
  <li>Attempting to totally eliminate conflict would be unrealistic and even harmful, because certain level of tension may stimulate <strong>creativity and change</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Conflict is a Process, Not a Single Event</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Conflict does not appear suddenly; it usually develops through a <strong>series of stages</strong>: latent conflict (underlying tension) → perceived conflict → felt conflict (emotional involvement) → manifest conflict (open behaviour).</li>
  <li>Understanding this process helps managers to intervene at an early stage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Conflict is Based on Perception</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Conflict is often created or intensified by the way people <strong>perceive</strong> a situation rather than by objective facts.</li>
  <li>Misunderstandings, rumours or misinterpretation of intentions can lead to conflict even when actual interests are not fundamentally opposed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Conflict May Be Overt or Covert</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Overt conflict</strong> is openly expressed in the form of arguments, strikes, written complaints, non-cooperation.</li>
  <li><strong>Covert conflict</strong> remains hidden; it appears as passive resistance, delay, poor quality, withdrawal or silence. Covert conflict is often more dangerous because it is difficult to detect.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Conflict Occurs at Various Levels</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It may occur within an individual (inner conflict), between individuals, between an individual and a group, or between different groups and departments.</li>
  <li>Therefore, managers must be able to recognise and handle conflict at <strong>multiple levels</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Conflict May Be Functional or Dysfunctional</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When conflict leads to <strong>better decisions, clarification of issues, innovation and higher involvement</strong>, it is called <strong>functional (constructive)</strong> conflict.</li>
  <li>When it leads to <strong>hostility, reduced cooperation, lowered performance and break-down of communication</strong>, it is called <strong>dysfunctional (destructive)</strong> conflict.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Conflict in Organisations</h2>
<p>From the viewpoint of Psychology for Managers, conflict can be classified on different bases. Some important types are:</p>

<h3>I. On the Basis of Levels</h3>

<h3>1. Intrapersonal Conflict (Within the Individual)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Occurs when an individual experiences <strong>inner tension or confusion</strong> due to incompatible motives, values or expectations.</li>
  <li>Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Role conflict – when a person faces conflicting expectations within his job (e.g., pressure to increase sales but also to avoid risky credit).</li>
      <li>Approach–avoidance conflict – when the same goal has both attractive and unattractive aspects (e.g., promotion in another city – higher status vs. leaving family).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Unresolved intrapersonal conflict may lead to stress, anxiety and poor performance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Interpersonal Conflict (Between Individuals)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Conflict between two or more individuals due to <strong>differences in personality, values, perceptions, goals or communication</strong>.</li>
  <li>Examples: conflict between a supervisor and a subordinate, or between colleagues competing for promotion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Intragroup Conflict (Within a Group)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Occurs among members of the same group or team.</li>
  <li>May arise due to role ambiguity, unequal workload, competition for recognition, or disagreement on methods.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Intergroup Conflict (Between Groups / Departments)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Conflict between different <strong>departments, sections or groups</strong> – e.g., production vs. sales, management vs. union.</li>
  <li>Groups may develop their own goals and norms which sometimes clash with those of other groups.</li>
</ul>

<h3>II. On the Basis of Causes</h3>

<h3>1. Task Conflict</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Conflict related to the <strong>content and goals of the work</strong> – what should be done, how it should be done, what priorities to set.</li>
  <li>Moderate level of task conflict can be healthy by encouraging critical evaluation and better solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Relationship (Emotional) Conflict</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Conflict arising from <strong>personal dislike, anger, mistrust or negative emotions</strong> among individuals.</li>
  <li>Usually harmful for cooperation and performance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Process Conflict</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Conflict regarding <strong>how the work should be organised and responsibilities distributed</strong>.</li>
  <li>Example: disagreement on who should do what, deadlines and procedures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Causes / Sources of Organisational Conflict</h2>
<p>Several factors in organisations contribute to the emergence of conflict. Important causes are:</p>

<h3>1. Scarcity of Resources</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When resources such as <strong>budget, manpower, equipment, space or time</strong> are limited, departments and individuals compete for a larger share.</li>
  <li>This competition often leads to conflict, especially when allocation is perceived as unfair.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Goal Differences</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Different departments may have <strong>different and sometimes incompatible goals</strong>.</li>
  <li>Example: Production department may focus on efficiency and long runs, whereas Sales department may demand variety and quick delivery to satisfy customers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Role Ambiguity and Role Conflict</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When roles and responsibilities are <strong>not clearly defined</strong>, or when a person receives conflicting expectations from different superiors, conflict arises.</li>
  <li>Example: One superior instructs to cut costs, another directs to improve quality regardless of cost.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Communication Problems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Poor communication, misunderstandings, incomplete information or wrong assumptions are major sources of conflict.</li>
  <li>Ambiguous language, noise, rumours and lack of feedback intensify conflict.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Differences in Perception and Values</h3>
<ul>
  <li>People differ in their <strong>perception of reality</strong>, values, beliefs and attitudes.</li>
  <li>The same situation may be viewed as an opportunity by one person and as a threat by another.</li>
  <li>Such differences in perception and value judgement often generate conflict.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Personality Clashes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Differences in personality traits – e.g., aggressive vs. mild, authoritarian vs. democratic – may result in <strong>interpersonal friction</strong>.</li>
  <li>Ego clashes and competitive individual behaviour may lead to frequent conflicts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Line–Staff Differences</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Line managers are responsible for production or sales; staff specialists provide advice in areas such as finance, HR, legal, etc.</li>
  <li>Line managers may feel that staff suggestions are impractical, whereas staff may feel their advice is being ignored. This difference in viewpoint may lead to conflict.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Organisational Structure and System</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Highly centralised structures, rigid rules, multiple levels of hierarchy, and overlapping authority can create frustration and conflict.</li>
  <li>Reward systems that encourage competition between individuals or departments may also generate conflict.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9. Change and Uncertainty</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction of new technologies, changes in policies or restructuring create <strong>uncertainty and fear</strong>.</li>
  <li>Employees or groups who feel threatened may resist and come into conflict with those who support change.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Consequences / Effects of Conflict</h2>
<p>The impact of conflict can be both positive and negative. The actual consequence depends on the <strong>intensity of conflict</strong> and how it is managed.</p>

<h3>I. Functional (Positive) Consequences</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clarification of issues:</strong> Conflict forces people to examine facts, assumptions and viewpoints more carefully, leading to better understanding.</li>
  <li><strong>Stimulation of creativity and innovation:</strong> Differences in opinion may lead to new ideas and improved methods.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved decision-making:</strong> Constructive debate improves the quality of decisions and prevents blind conformity.</li>
  <li><strong>Encouragement of change:</strong> Conflict may expose weaknesses in existing systems and stimulate necessary reforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Strengthening of group identity:</strong> Facing an external conflict may unite group members and increase cohesiveness (“we must stand together”).</li>
</ul>

<h3>II. Dysfunctional (Negative) Consequences</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reduced cooperation:</strong> Parties in conflict may withhold information, refuse help and become uncooperative.</li>
  <li><strong>Decrease in performance:</strong> Energy is diverted from productive work to fighting, complaining and defending positions.</li>
  <li><strong>Poor communication:</strong> Communication becomes distorted; people talk less or more defensively, rumours increase.</li>
  <li><strong>Stress and dissatisfaction:</strong> Prolonged unresolved conflict causes stress, anxiety, absenteeism and turnover.</li>
  <li><strong>Destruction of relationships:</strong> Severe conflict may lead to breakdown of trust, long-term hostility and sometimes disciplinary cases or litigation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the aim of management is not to remove all conflict, but to <strong>control its level</strong> and manage it so that functional outcomes are maximised and dysfunctional outcomes are minimised.</p>

<h2>Management and Resolution of Conflict</h2>
<p>Managers can use several techniques to prevent, manage and resolve conflict. These may be classified as <strong>preventive (structural)</strong> and <strong>behavioural (interpersonal)</strong> techniques.</p>

<h3>I. Preventive / Structural Techniques</h3>

<h3>1. Clarifying Goals, Roles and Expectations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Many conflicts arise from ambiguity in duties and objectives.</li>
  <li>Clearly defined <strong>job roles, performance standards and organisational goals</strong> reduce confusion and overlapping.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Improving Communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Provide <strong>timely, accurate and complete information</strong> to all concerned.</li>
  <li>Encourage two-way communication, feedback and joint meetings.</li>
  <li>Clarify misunderstandings quickly before they grow into major conflicts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Proper Coordination and Integration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use integrative mechanisms like <strong>liaison officers, cross-functional teams, task forces and committees</strong> to coordinate activities between departments.</li>
  <li>Joint planning and decision-making help reduce interdepartmental conflict.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Fair Policies and Reward Systems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that organisational policies regarding promotion, transfers, rewards and discipline are <strong>fair, transparent and consistently applied</strong>.</li>
  <li>Design reward systems that encourage <strong>cooperation</strong> rather than destructive competition.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Reducing Excessive Interdependence</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Where conflict arises due to excessive dependence of one unit on another, management may <strong>re-design workflows</strong>, standardise procedures or provide buffer stocks to reduce friction.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Participative Decision-Making</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Involve those affected by decisions in the decision-making process.</li>
  <li>Participation increases acceptance and decreases chances of conflict arising out of imposed decisions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>II. Behavioural / Interpersonal Techniques</h3>

<h3>1. Avoidance (Sometimes Temporary)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In minor or emotional conflicts, it may be wise to <strong>postpone direct confrontation</strong> until parties cool down.</li>
  <li>However, avoidance is only a temporary measure and should not replace genuine resolution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Smoothing (Accommodating)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One party may emphasise areas of agreement and downplay differences to maintain harmony.</li>
  <li>Useful when the issue is not very important and relationship is more valuable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Compromise</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Each party gives up something and <strong>reaches a middle ground</strong>.</li>
  <li>Widely used in organisations because it is practical and quick, though it may not satisfy all needs fully.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Collaboration (Problem-Solving)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Parties jointly identify the problem, explore alternatives and search for a solution that satisfies the <strong>interests of both sides</strong> (win–win solution).</li>
  <li>Requires open communication, trust and willingness to listen.</li>
  <li>Most desirable in the long run for important issues.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Use of Authority (Competition / Domination)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sometimes the manager has to <strong>impose a decision</strong> using formal authority, particularly when quick action is essential or safety is involved.</li>
  <li>However, frequent use of domination may create resentment and hidden conflict.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Third-Party Intervention</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When parties cannot resolve conflict themselves, a neutral third party such as a <strong>mediator, arbitrator, senior manager or external consultant</strong> may assist.</li>
  <li>The third party helps in clarifying issues, suggesting solutions and sometimes giving binding decisions (in arbitration).</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Counselling and Training</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Managers can provide <strong>counselling</strong> to individuals suffering from intrapersonal conflict or interpersonal tensions.</li>
  <li>Training in communication, listening skills, emotional control and negotiation can reduce future conflicts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Managerial Role in Conflict Handling</h2>
<p>From the perspective of Psychology for Managers, the manager should aim not at eliminating all conflict but at <strong>managing conflict intelligently</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Diagnose the <strong>type, level and causes</strong> of conflict accurately.</li>
  <li>Encourage <strong>constructive, task-related conflict</strong> to improve decisions, while controlling destructive, personal conflict.</li>
  <li>Adopt appropriate strategies (collaboration, compromise, smoothing, authoritative decision) depending on the situation.</li>
  <li>Develop a climate of <strong>trust, fairness and open communication</strong> so that conflicts can be discussed and resolved early.</li>
</ul>

<p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion.</strong> To conclude, organisational conflict is a natural outcome of differences in goals, perceptions, values and interests among individuals and groups working together under conditions of limited resources and interdependence. It is a psychological as well as structural phenomenon and may occur at intra-individual, interpersonal, intragroup and intergroup levels. Conflict is not always harmful; when properly handled it can become a <strong>functional force</strong> leading to improved decisions, creativity and change. However, unresolved or excessive conflict becomes <strong>dysfunctional</strong> and damages performance, morale and relationships. Therefore, managers must understand the nature, types, causes and consequences of conflict and use appropriate structural and behavioural techniques—such as clarifying roles, improving communication, fair policies, participation, negotiation, collaboration and third-party intervention—to manage and resolve conflict. In this way, conflict can be transformed from a source of stress into a powerful instrument for <strong>organisational development and psychological growth</strong> of employees.</p>

  This answer forms part of a carefully curated set of important questions that have frequently appeared in
  past university examinations and therefore hold a high probability of reappearing in future assessments.
  While prepared with academic accuracy and aligned with the standard B.Com (Sem I) syllabus of Psychology for
  Managers (Kalyani Publications — Shashi K. Gupta &amp; Rosy Joshi), these notes should be treated as
