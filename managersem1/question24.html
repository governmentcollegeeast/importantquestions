Q24. What is group decision-making? Explain its meaning and characteristics. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of group decisions. Describe the main techniques of group decision-making and give suggestions for making group decisions more effective in organisations.
</p>

<article>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> Decision-making is the heart of managerial activity. At every level, managers are required to choose among alternatives related to goals, policies, procedures, methods, staffing and control. Traditionally, decisions were viewed as the responsibility of <strong>individual managers</strong>. However, modern organisations increasingly rely on <strong>group decision-making</strong> – committees, teams, task forces, quality circles – especially where problems are complex and affect diverse interests. From the viewpoint of “Psychology for Managers”, group decisions are important because they involve <strong>interaction of personalities, group norms, leadership, communication and group dynamics</strong>. Group decision-making can lead to higher quality and acceptance of decisions, but may also suffer from delay, compromise and “groupthink” if not properly managed.</p>

<h2>Meaning and Definition of Group Decision-Making</h2>
<p><strong>Simple meaning:</strong> Group decision-making means a situation where <strong>two or more individuals collectively analyse a problem, discuss alternatives and jointly choose a course of action</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Exam-oriented definition:</strong> Group decision-making may be defined as the <strong>process in which decisions are taken by a number of individuals acting together as a group (committee, team, task force etc.), through interaction, discussion and sharing of information, rather than by a single individual alone</strong>.</p>

<p>Thus, in group decision-making:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>problem, alternatives and consequences</strong> are considered jointly,</li>
  <li>Decision is influenced by <strong>group norms, leadership, communication patterns and power structure</strong>, and</li>
  <li>The final decision typically carries the <strong>support or consent of several members</strong>, not just one manager.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Characteristics / Nature of Group Decision-Making</h2>
<p>Important features of group decisions are as follows:</p>

<h3>1. Participation of Two or More Persons</h3>
<ul>
  <li>By definition, group decisions involve <strong>more than one person</strong>. The group may be small (3–5 members) or large (committees, boards).</li>
  <li>Members may belong to the same department or to different functions (cross-functional teams).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Interaction and Exchange of Information</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Group decisions are based on <strong>face-to-face or virtual interaction</strong> among members.</li>
  <li>Information, ideas, opinions and feelings are exchanged through discussion, questions and clarification.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Collective Responsibility (Shared Ownership)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The decision emerging from a group is normally regarded as a <strong>collective decision</strong>.</li>
  <li>Members share responsibility for its consequences, which increases their <strong>commitment to implementation</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Influence of Group Dynamics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Group decisions are strongly affected by <strong>group norms, cohesiveness, leadership style, communication network and status differences</strong>.</li>
  <li>For example, a dominant leader may influence or suppress others; cohesive groups may seek harmony rather than critical evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Time-Consuming Process</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Because it involves discussion among several people, group decision-making usually takes <strong>more time</strong> than individual decision-making.</li>
  <li>It may involve multiple meetings and stages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Potential for Higher Quality and Acceptance</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Collective decisions draw on <strong>more information, experience and viewpoints</strong>, which may improve quality.</li>
  <li>Involvement in decision-making generally leads to <strong>greater acceptance and commitment</strong> among members.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advantages / Merits of Group Decisions</h2>
<p>From the managerial and psychological point of view, group decision-making offers several benefits:</p>

<h3>1. More Information and Knowledge</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Each member brings his or her <strong>experience, technical expertise and perspective</strong>.</li>
  <li>Pooling of knowledge enables the group to consider more aspects of the problem than an individual could.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Greater Diversity of Viewpoints</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Group discussion encourages <strong>different opinions and approaches</strong> to surface.</li>
  <li>Alternative solutions may be generated which a single person might not think of.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Better Quality Decisions (When Well Managed)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Critical questioning and cross-checking of assumptions can <strong>improve the rationality</strong> of decisions.</li>
  <li>Errors of individual bias may be corrected by other members.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Higher Acceptance and Commitment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When employees participate in decision-making, they feel a sense of <strong>ownership</strong>.</li>
  <li>This increases their <strong>commitment to implementing</strong> the decision and reduces resistance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Increased Understanding and Communication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Group discussion allows members to <strong>clarify doubts, understand reasons</strong> for decisions, and hear others’ viewpoints.</li>
  <li>This improves communication and coordination during implementation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Development of Employees</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Participation in decision-making provides <strong>learning opportunities</strong> – improving problem-solving, analytical and communication skills.</li>
  <li>It prepares subordinates for <strong>higher responsibilities</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Support for Democratic and Participative Culture</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Group decisions are consistent with <strong>participative management</strong>, which respects human dignity and encourages involvement.</li>
  <li>This helps in building a positive organisational climate and better industrial relations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages / Limitations of Group Decisions</h2>
<p>Despite many merits, group decision-making also has certain drawbacks, especially if poorly handled:</p>

<h3>1. Time-Consuming and Costly</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Arranging meetings, collecting information and reconciling differing views is <strong>time-consuming</strong>.</li>
  <li>The time of several people is involved, which increases <strong>cost</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Risk of Indecision and Delay</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Groups sometimes find it difficult to <strong>reach agreement</strong>, especially when members hold strong conflicting views.</li>
  <li>This may result in indecision, postponement or very slow decisions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Compromise Decisions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To achieve consensus, groups may adopt a <strong>middle-of-the-road compromise</strong> which is acceptable to all but optimal to none.</li>
  <li>Such decisions may lack boldness and innovation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Domination by a Few Members</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Strong, vocal or high-status members may dominate discussion.</li>
  <li>Quiet or lower-status members may hesitate to express honest opinions, leading to a decision that reflects mainly the views of a few.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Groupthink</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In highly cohesive groups, a desire for <strong>harmony and agreement</strong> may become so strong that members avoid expressing doubts or criticisms.</li>
  <li>This phenomenon is called <strong>groupthink</strong>; it leads to poor decisions because alternatives are not critically examined.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Pressure to Conform</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Members may feel social pressure to <strong>conform to majority opinion</strong> even when they privately disagree.</li>
  <li>This reduces the benefit of diversity of viewpoints.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Responsibility Dilution</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When many people are involved, each individual may feel <strong>less personally responsible</strong> for the outcome (“no one person is accountable”).</li>
  <li>This diffusion of responsibility may negatively affect implementation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Main Techniques of Group Decision-Making</h2>
<p>Several structured techniques have been developed to improve the effectiveness of group decisions. Important techniques for B.Com (Sem I) level are:</p>

<h3>1. Brainstorming</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Brainstorming is a technique for generating a <strong>large number of ideas</strong> about a problem in a group setting, without immediate criticism or evaluation.</p>

<p><strong>Process / Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A small group (6–12 members) is formed with a leader (facilitator).</li>
  <li>The problem is clearly stated and understood by all.</li>
  <li>Members are invited to suggest as many ideas as possible, often in free association.</li>
  <li><strong>No criticism, evaluation or discussion</strong> of ideas is allowed during the idea-generation phase; even apparently “wild” ideas are encouraged.</li>
  <li>All ideas are written down for later analysis.</li>
  <li>After the generation phase, ideas are <strong>evaluated, combined and refined</strong> to identify practical solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Encourages creativity, breaks habitual thinking patterns, involves all members. <br>
<strong>Limitations:</strong> May produce many impractical ideas; requires skillful facilitation; some members may still remain passive.</p>

<h3>2. Nominal Group Technique (NGT)</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Nominal Group Technique is a structured method of group decision-making that combines <strong>individual idea generation with group discussion</strong> and ranking.</p>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Members meet in a group but initially <strong>work silently and independently</strong>. Each member writes down ideas about the problem.</li>
  <li>In a round-robin fashion, each member presents one idea at a time; ideas are listed on a board without discussion.</li>
  <li>After listing, members discuss each idea to clarify meaning, but still no evaluation.</li>
  <li>Finally, each member <strong>privately ranks or votes</strong> on the ideas (e.g., by giving points).</li>
  <li>Rankings are combined to identify the group’s preferred solution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Reduces domination by a few; allows equal contribution; balances advantages of individual thinking and group interaction. <br>
<strong>Limitations:</strong> More formal and time-consuming; may limit spontaneous discussion.</p>

<h3>3. Delphi Technique</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Delphi Technique is a method of group decision-making where <strong>experts do not meet face-to-face</strong>; instead, they respond to questionnaires in several rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A coordinator sends a questionnaire to selected experts, asking for opinions or forecasts on a problem.</li>
  <li>Responses are collected, summarised and anonymised by the coordinator.</li>
  <li>The summary is sent back to the experts along with a second questionnaire; experts may revise their earlier responses after seeing the group summary.</li>
  <li>This process may be repeated for multiple rounds until opinions converge.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Avoids influence of dominant individuals; experts can be geographically dispersed; useful for long-term forecasting. <br>
<strong>Limitations:</strong> Time-consuming and costly; lacks face-to-face debate; depends on quality of questionnaires.</p>

<h3>4. Committee Meetings</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Committees are formal groups constituted by management to <strong>deliberate on specific issues</strong> and make recommendations or decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Have defined membership, terms of reference and often a chairperson.</li>
  <li>Meet periodically to consider matters assigned to them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Facilitate representation of different departments; provide a forum for consultation and coordination; ensure that various viewpoints are considered. <br>
<strong>Limitations:</strong> Can become bureaucratic, slow and dominated by a few; risk of “minutes are taken, but hours are wasted” if not well managed.</p>

<h3>5. Quality Circles / Work Committees</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Quality circles are small groups of employees from the same work area who <strong>voluntarily meet</strong> regularly to identify, analyse and solve work-related problems, especially related to quality and productivity.</p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Members usually share similar tasks; they know the problems intimately.</li>
  <li>Meetings are often held during working hours under the guidance of a facilitator.</li>
  <li>Solutions are presented to management for implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Merits:</strong> Improve quality, motivate workers, develop problem-solving skills, strengthen cooperation between workers and management. <br>
<strong>Demerits:</strong> Success depends on sustained management support; may fail if suggestions are consistently ignored.</p>

<h3>6. Participative Management (General Approach)</h3>
<p>Beyond specific techniques, <strong>participative management</strong> is a broader philosophy where employees at different levels are <strong>involved in decision-making</strong> related to their work – through meetings, joint consultative councils, worker-directors etc. It aims to integrate <strong>organisational efficiency with worker satisfaction</strong>.</p>

<h2>Guidelines / Suggestions for Making Group Decisions More Effective</h2>
<p>To gain the benefits and reduce the drawbacks of group decisions, managers should follow certain guidelines:</p>

<h3>1. Appropriate Group Size and Composition</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Keep groups to a <strong>manageable size</strong> (often 5–9 members) – large enough for diversity, small enough for effective participation.</li>
  <li>Include members with <strong>relevant knowledge and stake</strong> in the decision.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Clear Definition of Problem and Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>At the beginning, clearly define:
    <ul>
      <li>What is the problem?</li>
      <li>What are the objectives and constraints?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A clear problem statement prevents irrelevant discussion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Encouraging Free and Equal Participation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Leaders should <strong>encourage all members</strong>, especially quieter ones, to express their views.</li>
  <li>Domination by a few should be controlled tactfully.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Separating Idea Generation from Evaluation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Initially focus on <strong>generating ideas</strong> without criticism (brainstorming style).</li>
  <li>Only later proceed to evaluate and compare alternatives. This increases creativity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Guarding Against Groupthink</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Leaders should avoid pressuring for quick agreement.</li>
  <li>Encourage members to be “<strong>critical evaluators</strong>” and to consider possible weaknesses in proposed solutions.</li>
  <li>Sometimes, one member may be formally assigned the role of “<strong>devil’s advocate</strong>” to question assumptions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Summarising and Recording Decisions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>At the end of discussion, the leader should <strong>summarise the decision</strong>, responsibilities and time schedule.</li>
  <li>Preparing a brief written record improves clarity and follow-up.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Ensuring Implementation and Feedback</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Decisions should not remain on paper; they must be translated into <strong>specific action plans</strong> with assigned responsibilities.</li>
  <li>Obtain feedback on results and, if necessary, <strong>review or modify</strong> decisions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Role of Manager in Group Decision-Making</h2>
<p>From the perspective of Psychology for Managers, the manager’s role is to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose when to use group decision-making and when individual decision is preferable (e.g., in emergencies or where confidentiality is crucial).</li>
  <li>Select appropriate <strong>group decision techniques</strong> (brainstorming, NGT, committee, quality circle) according to the nature of the problem.</li>
  <li>Act as a <strong>facilitator</strong>, not a dictator – encouraging participation, managing conflict and guiding discussion logically.</li>
  <li>Guard against negative phenomena such as <strong>groupthink, domination and diffusion of responsibility</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion.</strong> To conclude, group decision-making is a process in which two or more individuals jointly analyse problems, generate alternatives and choose a course of action through interaction and discussion. It is an important aspect of modern management and organisational psychology because it reflects the operation of group dynamics, leadership and communication. Group decisions have significant advantages – more information and ideas, higher quality decisions, greater acceptance and better communication – but they also suffer from disadvantages such as delay, compromise, domination by a few and the risk of groupthink. Techniques like <strong>brainstorming, nominal group technique, Delphi technique, committees and quality circles</strong> have been developed to harness the strengths and reduce the weaknesses of group decisions. A wise manager uses group decision-making selectively and designs the process carefully, ensuring clear problem definition, balanced participation, critical evaluation and effective follow-up. Properly planned and managed, group decision-making becomes a powerful tool for achieving <strong>superior organisational performance along with higher employee involvement and satisfaction</strong>.</p>

  This answer forms part of a carefully curated set of important questions that have frequently appeared in
  past university examinations and therefore hold a high probability of reappearing in future assessments.
  While prepared with academic accuracy and aligned with the standard B.Com (Sem I) syllabus of Psychology for
  Managers (Kalyani Publications — Shashi K. Gupta &amp; Rosy Joshi), these notes should be treated as
  high-quality preparation material rather than a guaranteed prediction of any upcoming exam paper.
