<p class="question">Q22. What is a group? Distinguish between formal and informal groups. Explain their types, characteristics, advantages and disadvantages from the point of view of management.</p>

<article>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> In every organisation people do not work in complete isolation. They come together, interact, share information, develop common interests and form <strong>groups</strong>. Some of these groups are <strong>deliberately created by management</strong> to perform specific tasks (departments, committees), while others arise <strong>spontaneously</strong> out of social and psychological needs (friendship circles, lunch groups). From the angle of “Psychology for Managers”, the study of groups is extremely important because groups strongly influence <strong>attitudes, performance, motivation, morale, communication, leadership and resistance to change</strong>. A manager who ignores group forces is like a doctor who ignores blood pressure – he may prescribe medicines, but real health will not improve.</p>

<h2>Meaning and Definition of Group</h2>
<p><strong>Simple meaning:</strong> A group is a collection of two or more persons who <strong>interact with one another, share common goals, and perceive themselves as belonging together</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Exam-oriented definition:</strong> A group may be defined as a <strong>set of individuals who have regular and meaningful interaction with each other, are psychologically aware of one another, share some common objectives and norms, and consider themselves to be members of the same unit</strong>.</p>

<p>Thus, a group is not merely a crowd. People waiting at a bus stop may be physically together but they do not have <strong>interaction, common goals or a sense of “we-feeling”</strong>; therefore, they do not form a group in the psychological sense.</p>

<h2>Nature / Characteristics of Groups</h2>
<p>The essential features of groups in organisations are:</p>

<h3>1. Two or More Persons</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A group must consist of <strong>at least two persons</strong>. A single individual working alone is not a group.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Interaction and Interdependence</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Group members engage in <strong>reciprocal interaction</strong> – they talk to each other, exchange information and influence each other.</li>
  <li>They are also <strong>interdependent</strong>; actions of one member affect the others.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Common Goals and Interests</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Members have some <strong>shared objectives</strong> – completing a project, achieving sales target, defending common rights, or simply enjoying each other’s company.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Group Norms and Roles</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Over time, groups develop <strong>norms</strong> – shared expectations about acceptable behaviour (e.g., “we do not report each other’s small mistakes to the boss”).</li>
  <li>Members occupy <strong>roles</strong> – leader, follower, critic, peacemaker etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Sense of Belonging (“We-feeling”)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Members feel that they <strong>belong to the group</strong> and identify themselves with it.</li>
  <li>This creates “in-group” feeling and sometimes negative attitude towards “outsiders”.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Continuity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Groups usually have some degree of <strong>relative stability over time</strong>, even though individual members may change.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Classification of Groups in Organisations</h2>
<p>Groups in organisations may be classified on various bases. An important classification for B.Com (Sem I) is between <strong>formal and informal groups</strong>.</p>

<h2>I. Formal Groups</h2>
<p><strong>Meaning.</strong> Formal groups are those which are <strong>deliberately created by the management</strong> to achieve specific organisational objectives. Their structure, authority, responsibilities and relationships are officially defined in the organisation chart or rules.</p>

<p>Examples: departments (production, sales, accounts), sections, committees, project teams, quality control circles formed by management.</p>

<h3>Types of Formal Groups</h3>
<p>Formal groups may be of different types:</p>

<h3>1. Command or Functional Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Consist of a manager and his direct subordinates as shown in the organisational hierarchy.</li>
  <li>Example: A marketing manager and his sales officers; a production superintendent and his foremen.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Task or Project Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Formed to carry out a <strong>specific task or project</strong> such as launching a new product, installing a new machine, organising a training programme.</li>
  <li>Members may belong to different departments (cross-functional teams).</li>
  <li>These groups are often temporary; they may be dissolved after the task is completed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Committee Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Formally constituted groups which meet periodically to <strong>consider and decide specific matters</strong> – e.g., purchase committee, canteen committee, safety committee.</li>
  <li>Committees may be advisory or decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Characteristics of Formal Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Created by management to fulfil <strong>organisational goals</strong>.</li>
  <li>Have clearly defined <strong>structure, authority and responsibility</strong>.</li>
  <li>Work is guided by <strong>rules, procedures and job descriptions</strong>.</li>
  <li>Membership is determined by <strong>appointment, transfer or position</strong>, not by personal choice.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages of Formal Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Role clarity:</strong> Members know their duties, reporting relationships and authority.</li>
  <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> Formal groups facilitate coordination of activities through defined channels.</li>
  <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Responsibility for results can be clearly fixed on individuals and units.</li>
  <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> Rules and procedures help maintain order and control.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations of Formal Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rigidity:</strong> Strict rules may restrict creativity and flexibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Impersonal relations:</strong> Formal groups emphasise roles, not persons; this may reduce emotional satisfaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Limited satisfaction of social needs:</strong> Formal structure may not fully satisfy needs for friendship, belongingness and informal support.</li>
  <li><strong>Possibility of bureaucracy:</strong> Too much emphasis on formality may lead to red-tapism and delay.</li>
</ul>

<h2>II. Informal Groups</h2>
<p><strong>Meaning.</strong> Informal groups are those which <strong>arise spontaneously</strong> out of interaction among people working together, to satisfy their <strong>social and psychological needs</strong>. They are not created or officially recognised by management, though they exist within the organisation.</p>

<p>Examples: friendship groups, groups of workers who take lunch together, cricket or WhatsApp groups among colleagues, groups formed on the basis of language, caste, age, hobbies etc.</p>

<h3>Types of Informal Groups</h3>

<h3>1. Friendship Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li>People who <strong>like each other’s company</strong> come together to share experiences, jokes, personal matters.</li>
  <li>Membership is based on <strong>personal liking and compatibility</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Interest Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Formed around a <strong>common interest or objective</strong> – e.g., a group demanding better canteen facilities, or a group interested in yoga, cultural activities, social work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Clique and Reference Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Small, tightly knit sub-groups that often influence opinion in larger groups.</li>
  <li>Members may use these groups as a <strong>reference point</strong> to evaluate their own behaviour and attitudes (“What do my group members think about this?”).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Characteristics of Informal Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li>They <strong>arise naturally</strong> and are not formally planned.</li>
  <li>Membership is based on <strong>personal choice, attraction and compatibility</strong>.</li>
  <li>They develop their own <strong>norms, status system, symbols and leaders</strong>.</li>
  <li>They fulfil strong social and psychological needs such as <strong>belongingness, security, recognition and emotional support</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages of Informal Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Satisfaction of social needs:</strong> Provide friendship, emotional support and a sense of belonging, which increases morale and reduces stress.</li>
  <li><strong>Speedy communication:</strong> The informal “grapevine” spreads information very quickly across the organisation.</li>
  <li><strong>Support to formal organisation:</strong> If informal leaders support organisational goals, informal groups can reinforce discipline, cooperation and productivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Source of new ideas:</strong> Informal discussions often generate suggestions for improvements which may not emerge in formal meetings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages / Dangers of Informal Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Spread of rumours:</strong> Grapevine may spread half-truths and false information, creating confusion and anxiety.</li>
  <li><strong>Resistance to change:</strong> Strong informal groups may oppose new policies, procedures or technologies and influence members to resist change.</li>
  <li><strong>Group pressure:</strong> Informal norms (e.g., “don’t work too fast or you’ll spoil the rate”) may discourage higher performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Cliques and conflicts:</strong> Rivalry between different informal groups may create tension and subcultures within the organisation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Formal vs Informal Groups — Points of Distinction</h2>
<p>For examination purposes, the differences between formal and informal groups may be summarised as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1. Origin:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Formal group: Created deliberately by management as part of organisational structure.</li>
      <li>Informal group: Emerges spontaneously from social interaction among employees.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>2. Purpose:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Formal: To achieve <strong>official organisational goals</strong> and perform assigned tasks.</li>
      <li>Informal: To satisfy <strong>social, emotional and psychological needs</strong> of members.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>3. Structure:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Formal: Has <strong>clearly defined structure</strong>, hierarchy, authority and responsibility.</li>
      <li>Informal: Structure is <strong>flexible and unwritten</strong>; based on personal attraction and common interests.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>4. Membership:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Formal: Determined by appointment, job position, transfer etc.</li>
      <li>Informal: Based on <strong>free choice</strong>; members join or leave voluntarily.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>5. Rules and Norms:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Formal: Guided by <strong>official rules, procedures and policies</strong>.</li>
      <li>Informal: Guided by <strong>unwritten norms</strong> developed by the group (e.g., “we help each other”, “we do not report minor mistakes”).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>6. Leadership:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Formal: Leader is <strong>officially appointed</strong> by management (manager, supervisor, committee chairman).</li>
      <li>Informal: Leader emerges <strong>spontaneously</strong> based on popularity, competence or seniority.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>7. Communication:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Formal: Communication flows through <strong>official channels</strong> – downward, upward, horizontal.</li>
      <li>Informal: Communication is <strong>spontaneous</strong>, multi-directional and often faster (grapevine).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>8. Stability:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Formal: More stable, continues even if individuals leave (the post remains, new person joins).</li>
      <li>Informal: Stability depends on <strong>personal relations</strong>; group may break if key members leave.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>9. Control over Members:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Formal: Control through <strong>official authority, rules, rewards and penalties</strong>.</li>
      <li>Informal: Control through <strong>group norms, approval or disapproval, social acceptance or rejection</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>10. Visibility to Management:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Formal: Fully visible and recognised by management.</li>
      <li>Informal: Often hidden or partly invisible; its influence must be understood through observation and interaction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Managerial Implications of Formal and Informal Groups</h2>
<p>For a manager, understanding and handling groups correctly is very important:</p>

<h3>1. Recognising the Reality of Informal Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Managers should understand that informal groups are <strong>natural and inevitable</strong>; trying to destroy them is neither possible nor desirable.</li>
  <li>The wise approach is to <strong>cooperate with informal leaders</strong> and to direct group energy towards organisational goals.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Using Informal Leaders Positively</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Informal leaders have great influence over their group members.</li>
  <li>If management wins their confidence, they can become <strong>valuable allies</strong> in implementing changes, maintaining discipline and improving morale.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Aligning Group Norms with Organisational Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Managers should try to ensure that informal group norms <strong>support productivity, quality and cooperation</strong>.</li>
  <li>Where norms discourage high performance (“don’t work too fast”), managers must use counselling, participation and improved incentive schemes to slowly change them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Improving Communication through Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Group meetings, team discussions and committees can be used to <strong>explain plans, clarify doubts and receive feedback</strong>.</li>
  <li>At the same time, managers must supply timely formal information to prevent harmful rumours on the grapevine.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Using Groups to Meet Social Needs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Since people have strong social needs, management can design <strong>work teams, joint activities, social and sports clubs</strong> to give employees healthy outlets for interaction.</li>
  <li>This reduces frustration and supports high morale.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Dealing with Negative Group Behaviour</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Where informal groups oppose organisational goals (e.g., promoting absenteeism, late coming, resistance to safety rules), managers must:
    <ul>
      <li>Diagnose the real causes of dissatisfaction,</li>
      <li>Hold discussions with group leaders,</li>
      <li>Make necessary improvements in policies and conditions, and</li>
      <li>Use proper disciplinary procedures if essential.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Advantages of Groups for Individuals and Organisation (Overall View)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>For individuals:</strong> Provide security, belongingness, status, emotional support, information and opportunities for self-expression.</li>
  <li><strong>For organisation:</strong> Enhance coordination, problem-solving, creativity, commitment, social control and communication.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages / Risks of Group Behaviour</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Group pressure may <strong>discourage innovation</strong> and maintain outdated practices.</li>
  <li>“Groupthink” – members may suppress dissent to maintain harmony, leading to poor decisions.</li>
  <li>Conflicts between groups (e.g., production vs. sales) may harm organisational interest.</li>
  <li>Strong informal groups may <strong>manipulate strikes or slow-downs</strong> if relations with management are strained.</li>
</ul>

<p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion.</strong> To conclude, a group is a collection of individuals who interact with one another, share common goals, develop norms and perceive themselves as members of the same unit. In organisations, groups may be <strong>formal</strong>, created by management to perform official tasks, or <strong>informal</strong>, arising spontaneously to satisfy social and psychological needs. Formal groups provide structure, clarity and accountability, while informal groups provide social satisfaction, emotional support and fast communication. Both types have advantages and disadvantages from the managerial point of view. Effective managers recognise the existence and strength of informal groups, work with their leaders, and try to align group norms with organisational objectives. By understanding group behaviour and managing it wisely, a manager can transform groups from potential sources of conflict into powerful instruments for achieving <strong>high productivity, sound human relations and organisational stability</strong>.</p>
