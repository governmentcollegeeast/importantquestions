Q12. What are the various characteristics of the perceiver, the perceived (target) and the situation which affect the perceptual process?
</p>

<article>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> Perception is a fundamental psychological process in organisational behaviour. In the same situation, two persons may behave very differently because
they <strong>perceive</strong> that situation in different ways. For a manager, it is therefore not enough to know the objective facts; he must also understand how people
<strong>interpret</strong> those facts. These interpretations are influenced by the characteristics of three important elements of the perceptual process: <strong>(i) the perceiver, (ii) the perceived object or target, and (iii) the situation or context</strong>. A systematic discussion of these three sets of characteristics is given below.</p>

<h2>Meaning of Perception (Brief Recap)</h2>
<p>Perception may be defined as the <strong>process by which individuals organise and interpret sensory impressions so as to give meaning to their environment</strong>. It involves selection of stimuli, organisation of selected information and interpretation according to one’s cognitive framework. Since perception is influenced by psychological factors, it is often <strong>subjective</strong> and may differ from objective reality.</p>

<h2>I. Characteristics of the Perceiver Affecting Perception</h2>
<p>The <strong>perceiver</strong> is the person who is observing or trying to make sense of another person, object or event. His own characteristics strongly colour what he sees. Important characteristics are:</p>

<h3>1. Self-Concept and Personality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An individual’s <strong>self-concept</strong> (how he views himself) acts as a frame through which he perceives others. A person who sees himself as competent and worthy is more likely to perceive others positively.</li>
  <li>Personality traits also influence perception:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authoritarian</strong> persons tend to categorise people rigidly as “right/wrong”, “obedient/disobedient”.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimistic</strong> people look for positive qualities; <strong>pessimistic</strong> people emphasise weaknesses.</li>
      <li>People high in <strong>self-confidence</strong> are less defensive and more willing to consider new information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Attitudes, Beliefs and Values</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Perception is heavily influenced by an individual’s <strong>attitudes</strong> towards people, jobs, unions, management, etc.</li>
  <li>For example, a supervisor who strongly believes that “workers are lazy” is likely to perceive normal requests for leave as signs of laziness or irresponsibility.</li>
  <li>Deeply held <strong>values and belief systems</strong> act as filters; information consistent with values is readily accepted, whereas inconsistent information may be ignored or distorted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Motives and Needs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unfulfilled <strong>needs and motives</strong> create a readiness to perceive certain objects or events.</li>
  <li>A hungry person will notice food-related cues; a promotion-seeking employee will interpret many actions of the boss in terms of their possible effect on his promotion.</li>
  <li>This is known as <strong>perceptual selectivity</strong> based on motivation: we see what we are motivated to see.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Past Experience and Learning</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Perception is shaped by what a person has <strong>learnt from previous experiences</strong>.</li>
  <li>If in the past a manager has experienced poor performance from contractual workers, he may perceive all contract workers as unreliable, even before evaluating their actual performance.</li>
  <li>Experiences create <strong>stereotypes</strong> and habits of interpretation that affect future perceptions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Expectations and Perceptual Set</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Expectations act as a powerful force in perception. We tend to perceive what we <strong>expect</strong> to perceive. This is called a <strong>perceptual set</strong>.</li>
  <li>For example, if a teacher has been told that a particular student is brilliant, she may interpret his average performance as only a temporary fluctuation; conversely, she may judge the same performance by another student as outstanding if she expected him to be weak.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Interests and Focus of Attention</h3>
<ul>
  <li>People selectively attend to information that relates to their <strong>current interests</strong>.</li>
  <li>A finance manager will notice cost-related aspects; a personnel manager will focus on human relations issues in the same situation.</li>
  <li>Limited attentional capacity forces the perceiver to pick and choose among many stimuli.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Emotional State and Mood</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A person’s momentary <strong>emotional condition</strong> (anger, joy, anxiety, frustration) colours his perception.</li>
  <li>An angry manager may interpret a minor error as deliberate disobedience; the same error may be seen as a simple oversight when he is in a relaxed mood.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Cultural and Social Background</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Perceivers belonging to different <strong>cultures, social classes or communities</strong> may interpret behaviours and symbols differently.</li>
  <li>Gestures that are acceptable in one culture may be perceived as rude or aggressive in another.</li>
</ul>

<h2>II. Characteristics of the Perceived (Target / Object)</h2>
<p>The <strong>perceived object or target</strong> may be a person, a group, a physical object, an event or a situation. Certain characteristics of the target attract attention and shape perception:</p>

<h3>1. Novelty and Familiarity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Novel or <strong>unusual objects</strong> stand out and are more likely to be noticed than familiar objects.</li>
  <li>For example, a new employee, an unusual dress style or an unexpected event draws attention and influences perception strongly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Size and Intensity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Larger, louder, brighter or more <strong>intense stimuli</strong> are more likely to be perceived.</li>
  <li>A loud voice, bold headlines, bright colours or a large office may convey greater importance or authority, sometimes beyond reality.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Motion and Activity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Moving objects attract more attention than stationary objects.</li>
  <li>In a meeting, a person who frequently moves, gestures or speaks is more likely to be noticed and may be perceived as more active or dominant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Repetition and Frequency</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Stimuli that are <strong>repeated</strong> again and again tend to be perceived more easily and remembered better (e.g., repeated advertisements, repeated instructions).</li>
  <li>However, excessive repetition may reduce attention if it becomes boring.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Contrast and Distinctiveness</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Objects that <strong>contrast</strong> with their background or with other stimuli are more striking.</li>
  <li>A person wearing very formal dress in an otherwise casual group, or a very quiet person in a highly talkative group, will be more easily noticed.</li>
  <li>Such distinctiveness may lead to <strong>overestimation</strong> of that person’s characteristics.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Status, Appearance and Physical Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>People often judge others by <strong>outward appearance</strong> – dress, cleanliness, facial expression, physical attractiveness, age, gender.</li>
  <li>High-status symbols such as big office, car, title or uniform may cause the perceiver to attribute greater competence or authority to the target, irrespective of actual ability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Verbal and Non-Verbal Cues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The words used by the target, his tone of voice, eye contact, posture and gestures provide important information.</li>
  <li>Non-verbal cues sometimes contradict verbal statements and strongly influence perception (e.g., saying “I am interested” while looking bored).</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Background of the Target (Figure–Ground Relationship)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Objects are not perceived in isolation; they are seen against a <strong>background</strong>.</li>
  <li>A behaviour may be given a different meaning depending on what else is happening around it. For example, a worker leaving his machine may be perceived differently when all others are working overtime as compared to when the shift is over.</li>
</ul>

<h2>III. Characteristics of the Situation / Context</h2>
<p>Perception does not occur in vacuum; it always takes place within a <strong>specific situation</strong>. Features of the surrounding environment influence how both the perceiver and the target are interpreted.</p>

<h3>1. Physical Context</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Physical setting such as <strong>location, lighting, temperature, seating arrangement and noise level</strong> affects perception.</li>
  <li>For example, the same remark of a supervisor may be perceived as friendly in an informal canteen setting but as authoritative in a formal office or factory floor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Social Context</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Perception is influenced by the <strong>presence of other people</strong> and by the social norms operating in the situation.</li>
  <li>A manager’s behaviour in front of subordinates may be interpreted differently from the same behaviour in a meeting of senior executives.</li>
  <li>Group membership, peer pressure and organisational culture form part of the social context.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Organisational Structure and Climate</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The organisation’s structure, rules, reward system and climate also shape perception.</li>
  <li>In a highly <strong>authoritarian climate</strong>, employees may perceive even small instructions as strict orders; in a participative climate, they may perceive the same as suggestions for cooperation.</li>
  <li>Past history of management–labour relations colours how new decisions are perceived.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Time Factor</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Perception is influenced by the <strong>time at which</strong> an event occurs and by preceding events.</li>
  <li>A request for leave during a busy production season may be perceived as irresponsible, whereas the same request during slack period may be perceived as reasonable.</li>
  <li>Length of exposure to a stimulus also matters; brief contacts may lead to superficial impressions, while long interactions permit more accurate perception.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Work and Non-Work Settings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The same behaviour may be interpreted differently depending on whether it occurs in a <strong>work setting</strong> (office, factory) or a <strong>non-work setting</strong> (party, family gathering).</li>
  <li>For example, joking and laughing may be acceptable at a social function but considered unprofessional during a serious meeting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Managerial Implications of Perceptual Factors</h2>
<p>Understanding how characteristics of the perceiver, perceived and situation influence perception has important implications for managers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Managers should realise that their own perceptions of subordinates are coloured by their <strong>attitudes, expectations and past experience</strong>. Hence they should consciously check for possible bias.</li>
  <li>They must also understand that employees may <strong>misperceive managerial actions</strong> because of their motives, emotions and group norms. Therefore, management should communicate clearly and provide opportunities for feedback.</li>
  <li>While evaluating performance, managers should consider situational factors such as workload, availability of resources, time pressure and support from others.</li>
  <li>Training programmes may be arranged to create awareness about <strong>perceptual errors</strong> such as stereotyping, halo effect, projection and selective perception so that employees and managers develop more accurate and fair perceptions.</li>
</ul>

<p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion.</strong> To conclude, perception is not a simple photographic reproduction of external reality; it is a <strong>selective and interpretative process</strong> shaped by many psychological and situational factors. Characteristics of the <strong>perceiver</strong> (such as self-concept, attitudes, motives, past experience, expectations, interests, emotions and culture), characteristics of the <strong>perceived object or target</strong> (such as novelty, size, intensity, motion, contrast, appearance and non-verbal cues) and characteristics of the <strong>situation</strong> (physical, social and organisational context, time and work setting) jointly determine what is perceived and how it is interpreted. For effective managerial behaviour, it is essential to understand these influences, to minimise bias and distortion, and to design communication and appraisal systems that take perceptual factors into account. Only then can managers hope to interpret human behaviour realistically and to build sound human relations in the organisation.</p>

  This answer forms part of a carefully curated set of important questions that have frequently appeared in
  past university examinations and therefore hold a high probability of reappearing in future assessments.
  While prepared with academic accuracy and aligned with the standard B.Com (Sem I) syllabus of Psychology for
  Managers (Kalyani Publications — Shashi K. Gupta &amp; Rosy Joshi), these notes should be treated as
  high-quality preparation material rather than a guaranteed prediction of any upcoming exam paper.
