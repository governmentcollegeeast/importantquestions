<p class="question">Q12. Define learning. Explain its meaning, nature, process and important theories of learning relevant to organisations.</p>

<article>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> In organisational behaviour and Psychology for Managers, <strong>learning</strong> occupies a central position. No individual is born with knowledge of how to operate machines, follow organisational rules, deal with customers, or work in teams. All such behaviour is acquired over time. When employees improve their skills, change their attitudes, adopt new work methods or modify old habits, they are essentially <strong>learning</strong>. For managers, understanding the nature, process and theories of learning is crucial because most managerial activities – training, coaching, performance appraisal, reward systems, discipline and organisational change – are aimed at influencing what and how people learn at work.</p>

<h2>Meaning and Definition of Learning</h2>
<p>In simple words, <strong>learning</strong> refers to a relatively permanent change in behaviour that occurs as a result of practice, experience or training.</p>

<p><strong>Exam-oriented definition:</strong> Learning may be defined as a <strong>relatively permanent change in behaviour, knowledge, skills or attitudes which occurs as a result of experience and practice and which cannot be explained by temporary factors such as fatigue, drugs or maturation</strong>.</p>

<p>Thus, when a worker becomes more efficient after training on a new machine, when an employee develops a positive attitude towards quality after a quality improvement programme, or when a manager learns to handle conflicts more constructively, learning has taken place.</p>

<h2>Nature and Characteristics of Learning</h2>
<p>Important features of learning, as discussed in organisational behaviour, are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>(i) Learning involves change:</strong> Learning results in some change in behaviour, whether overt (visible) or covert (internal attitude, value, understanding). However, <em>not all change is learning</em>; change due to illness, accidents or temporary moods is not learning.</li>

  <li><strong>(ii) Learning is relatively permanent:</strong> The change in behaviour brought about by learning is fairly enduring. A person who has truly learned a skill does not forget it immediately. Short-lived changes, such as momentary excitement, do not qualify as learning.</li>

  <li><strong>(iii) Learning is based on experience and practice:</strong> Learning occurs through direct experience, observation, study and practice. It does not happen automatically. Repetition and reinforcement strengthen learning.</li>

  <li><strong>(iv) Learning may be positive or negative:</strong> Positive learning results in desirable behaviour (e.g., safe working habits, punctuality). Negative learning results in undesirable behaviour (e.g., shortcuts, carelessness, absenteeism) if such behaviour is rewarded or not punished.</li>

  <li><strong>(v) Learning is an inferred process:</strong> Learning itself cannot be directly seen; it is inferred from changes in performance and behaviour. When a worker produces more output with fewer errors, we infer that learning has taken place.</li>

  <li><strong>(vi) Learning is purposeful and goal-oriented:</strong> Individuals learn because they want to satisfy certain needs or achieve certain goals. If they see no purpose, learning will be weak.</li>

  <li><strong>(vii) Learning is universal but individual:</strong> All normal human beings are capable of learning, but the <strong>rate and style</strong> of learning differ from person to person depending on intelligence, motivation, previous knowledge, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Importance of Learning in Organisations</h2>
<p>From a managerial point of view, learning is important because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is the basis for <strong>training and development</strong> of employees.</li>
  <li>It helps in <strong>changing attitudes and behaviour</strong> to support new policies, technologies and methods.</li>
  <li>It plays a crucial role in <strong>performance improvement</strong>, safety, quality and customer service.</li>
  <li>It supports the creation of a <strong>learning organisation</strong>, capable of continuous improvement and innovation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Process of Learning</h2>
<p>Learning is not a single event; it is a process involving several steps. Different authors use slightly different models, but a commonly accepted learning process in organisational behaviour involves the following elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Drive (or motivation)</li>
  <li>Cue (stimulus or signal)</li>
  <li>Response</li>
  <li>Reinforcement</li>
  <li>Feedback and repetition</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Drive (Motivation)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Learning begins with a <strong>drive</strong> or need – a state of tension that motivates the individual to act.</li>
  <li>Drives may be <strong>primary</strong> (hunger, thirst, physical comfort) or <strong>secondary</strong> (need for achievement, recognition, security, status).</li>
  <li>For example, a clerk who wants promotion (need for advancement) is motivated to learn computer skills.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Cues (Stimuli)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cues</strong> are stimuli or signals in the environment that indicate how and when a person should respond.</li>
  <li>Examples: instructions given by a supervisor, demonstrations in a training programme, signs on machines, behaviour of senior colleagues.</li>
  <li>Cues guide behaviour by showing possible ways of satisfying the drive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Response</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Response</strong> is the behaviour or action taken by the individual when exposed to a cue.</li>
  <li>For example, the employee attends a training session, practises a new method on the machine, or changes the way he deals with customers.</li>
  <li>Initially, responses may be incorrect or clumsy; with practice they become more accurate and efficient.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Reinforcement</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reinforcement</strong> is the most important element in the learning process. It refers to the <strong>consequence</strong> of a response which strengthens the S–R (stimulus–response) bond.</li>
  <li>If the response is followed by a <strong>reward</strong> (praise, promotion, higher pay, sense of achievement), the individual is more likely to repeat the behaviour. This is <strong>positive reinforcement</strong>.</li>
  <li>If the response leads to removal of an unpleasant condition (e.g., reduction of scolding after improved performance), it is also reinforcing (<strong>negative reinforcement</strong>).</li>
  <li>Repeated reinforcement makes learning stronger and more permanent.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Feedback and Practice</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Feedback</strong> provides information on the correctness of the response (e.g., test results, supervisor’s comments, performance reports).</li>
  <li>Based on feedback, the learner corrects mistakes and refines behaviour.</li>
  <li>Continuous <strong>practice</strong> converts newly learned behaviour into a habit or skill.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, learning may be summarised as: <em>Need → Cues → Response → Reinforcement → Practice → Permanent Behaviour Change</em>.</p>

<h2>Theories of Learning</h2>
<p>To explain how learning takes place, psychologists have developed several theories. For organisational behaviour and Psychology for Managers, the following theories are particularly important:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Classical Conditioning Theory</li>
  <li>Operant Conditioning Theory</li>
  <li>Cognitive Theory of Learning</li>
  <li>Social Learning (Observational) Theory</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. Classical Conditioning Theory</h2>
<p><strong>Classical conditioning</strong> was first demonstrated by the Russian physiologist <strong>Ivan Pavlov</strong> through his famous experiment on dogs.</p>

<h3>(a) Basic Idea</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pavlov rang a bell and then immediately presented food to a dog.</li>
  <li>Food naturally caused salivation (unconditioned response).</li>
  <li>After this pairing was repeated several times, the dog began to salivate <strong>even when only the bell was rung</strong>, even if no food was presented.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, a previously neutral stimulus (bell) became capable of producing a response because it was repeatedly associated with a naturally occurring stimulus (food). This is called classical conditioning.</p>

<h3>(b) Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unconditioned stimulus (UCS):</strong> A stimulus that naturally produces a response (food).</li>
  <li><strong>Unconditioned response (UCR):</strong> Natural response to UCS (salivation).</li>
  <li><strong>Conditioned stimulus (CS):</strong> Previously neutral stimulus that, after association, produces a response (bell).</li>
  <li><strong>Conditioned response (CR):</strong> Learned response to the conditioned stimulus (salivation to bell).</li>
</ul>

<h3>(c) Application in Organisations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Classical conditioning explains how people may develop emotional reactions (liking, fear, anxiety) to certain objects or situations at work.</li>
  <li>For example, if a supervisor always shouts at an employee in a particular office, the employee may develop anxiety whenever he enters that office, even if the supervisor is not present.</li>
  <li>Managers can create positive associations by pairing work with rewards, recognition and pleasant conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>(d) Limitations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Classical conditioning mainly explains <strong>involuntary, reflexive responses</strong> (like emotional reactions), not complex voluntary behaviour such as performing tasks or problem-solving.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Operant Conditioning Theory</h2>
<p><strong>Operant conditioning</strong>, developed by <strong>B.F. Skinner</strong>, is more relevant to organisational behaviour. It explains learning as a function of its <strong>consequences</strong>.</p>

<h3>(a) Basic Idea</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Behaviour that is followed by a <strong>reward</strong> is likely to be repeated; behaviour followed by an unpleasant consequence or no reward is less likely to be repeated.</li>
  <li>Thus, individuals “operate” on the environment and learn to repeat those behaviours which bring favourable outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>(b) Principles of Operant Conditioning</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Positive reinforcement:</strong> Providing a pleasant consequence (praise, bonus, promotion) after desired behaviour to increase its frequency.</li>
  <li><strong>Negative reinforcement:</strong> Removing an unpleasant condition when desired behaviour occurs (e.g., stopping criticism when performance improves). It also increases desired behaviour.</li>
  <li><strong>Punishment:</strong> Applying an unpleasant consequence (warning, fine) or withdrawing a pleasant one (suspension of privileges) to reduce undesired behaviour.</li>
  <li><strong>Extinction:</strong> Withholding all reinforcement for a behaviour so that it gradually disappears (e.g., ignoring attention-seeking behaviour).</li>
</ul>

<h3>(c) Schedules of Reinforcement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reinforcement may be given after <strong>each response</strong> (continuous schedule) or after <strong>some responses</strong> (intermittent schedule).</li>
  <li>Intermittent reinforcement (e.g., occasional praise, periodic bonuses) generally leads to more <strong>resistant and long-lasting learning</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>(d) Application in Organisations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Operant conditioning forms the basis of <strong>behaviour modification</strong> or <strong>OB Mod</strong> (Organisational Behaviour Modification).</li>
  <li>Managers can systematically reinforce desired behaviours such as punctuality, safety, quality performance and teamwork through well-designed reward systems.</li>
  <li>Undesired behaviours like absenteeism, indiscipline or wastage can be reduced through appropriate punishment and extinction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Cognitive Theory of Learning</h2>
<p><strong>Cognitive theories</strong> emphasise the role of mental processes such as thinking, understanding, insight and problem-solving in learning.</p>

<h3>(a) Main Ideas</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Individuals are not passive responders to stimuli; they are <strong>active information processors</strong>.</li>
  <li>They develop internal mental maps, expectations and understanding of cause–effect relationships.</li>
  <li>Learning often involves <strong>insight</strong> – a sudden realisation of the solution to a problem – rather than gradual trial and error.</li>
</ul>

<h3>(b) Application in Organisations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Learning in complex managerial and professional jobs often requires understanding principles, concepts and relationships, not just forming habits.</li>
  <li>Case studies, problem-solving exercises, simulations and discussions used in management education are based on cognitive learning.</li>
  <li>Managers must ensure that employees clearly understand the <strong>reasons behind procedures</strong>, not just the routines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Social Learning (Observational) Theory</h2>
<p><strong>Social learning theory</strong>, associated with <strong>Albert Bandura</strong>, is particularly important for Psychology for Managers.</p>

<h3>(a) Basic Idea</h3>
<ul>
  <li>People learn not only from direct experience but also by <strong>observing the behaviour of others</strong> (models) and the consequences of that behaviour.</li>
  <li>This is called <strong>observational learning</strong> or modelling.</li>
</ul>

<h3>(b) Processes in Social Learning</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Attention:</strong> The learner pays attention to the model (e.g., a senior worker or manager).</li>
  <li><strong>Retention:</strong> The learner remembers what has been observed.</li>
  <li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> The learner converts what is remembered into action.</li>
  <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> The learner is motivated to perform the behaviour, especially if the model is rewarded.</li>
</ul>

<h3>(c) Application in Organisations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>New employees learn a great deal by watching their seniors and supervisors.</li>
  <li>Coaching, mentoring, role-playing and on-the-job training are practical applications of social learning.</li>
  <li>Managers themselves act as <strong>role models</strong>; their honesty, punctuality, respect for others and work ethic strongly influence subordinates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Factors Influencing Learning in Organisations</h2>
<p>In addition to the learning theories, certain factors determine how effectively employees learn:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Highly motivated employees learn faster and retain longer.</li>
  <li><strong>Ability and aptitude:</strong> Individuals with higher intelligence and relevant background grasp new material more easily.</li>
  <li><strong>Prior knowledge and experience:</strong> Previous learning provides a foundation for new learning, but sometimes may also cause resistance.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice and repetition:</strong> Regular practice strengthens learning and converts it into skill.</li>
  <li><strong>Reinforcement and feedback:</strong> Proper rewards and timely feedback are essential for effective learning.</li>
  <li><strong>Training methods and environment:</strong> Well-designed training programmes, good teaching methods and supportive climate make learning easier.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Managerial Implications of Learning</h2>
<p>For managers, understanding learning has direct practical implications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designing effective <strong>training and development</strong> programmes based on principles of reinforcement, practice, modelling and cognitive understanding.</li>
  <li>Using <strong>reward systems</strong> to strengthen desired behaviours and discourage undesirable ones.</li>
  <li>Helping employees to <strong>unlearn old habits</strong> and acquire new ones during organisational change.</li>
  <li>Recognising individual differences in learning speed and style and providing appropriate support.</li>
</ul>

<p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> To conclude, learning is a relatively permanent change in behaviour that occurs as a result of experience and practice. It is fundamental to the functioning of individuals and organisations. The learning process involves drive, cues, response, reinforcement and feedback. Various theories – classical conditioning, operant conditioning, cognitive theory and social learning theory – explain different aspects of how people learn. For a manager, these theories are not merely academic; they provide practical guidelines for shaping employee behaviour through training, reinforcement, role modelling and creation of a supportive learning environment. In the modern competitive and changing business world, the ability of individuals and organisations to <strong>learn and relearn continuously</strong> has become a key source of long-term success.</p>
