Q18. What do you mean by values? Explain various sources of values.
</p>

<article>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> Every human being carries within himself a more or less organised set of beliefs about what is <strong>good or bad, right or wrong, important or unimportant</strong> in life. These deep-rooted standards are known as <strong>values</strong>. In managerial context, values play a crucial role because they influence a person’s <strong>attitudes, decisions and behaviour</strong> at work. For example, if honesty and hard work are central values for an employee, he will behave very differently from someone who values only money or power. Therefore, a student of “Psychology for Managers” must clearly understand the <strong>meaning of values</strong> and the <strong>major sources from which values are formed.</strong></p>

<h2>Meaning of Values</h2>
<p>In simple words, <strong>values are enduring beliefs about what is desirable or undesirable which guide an individual’s behaviour and evaluation of events.</strong></p>

<p>Main points included in this meaning are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Values are <strong>deeply held beliefs</strong> regarding what is right–wrong, good–bad, just–unjust, moral–immoral, important–unimportant.</li>
  <li>They act as <strong>standards or criteria</strong> for choosing among alternatives and for judging the behaviour of self and others.</li>
  <li>Values are relatively <strong>stable and long-lasting</strong>; they do not change from day to day, though they may slowly develop over time.</li>
  <li>Values are more <strong>general and abstract</strong> than attitudes. One value (e.g., honesty) can influence many specific attitudes and behaviours.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of common values are: honesty, truthfulness, respect for elders, obedience, hard work, discipline, independence, equality, justice, loyalty, achievement, material success, self-respect and so on.</p>

<h2>Characteristics / Nature of Values</h2>
<p>From the above, we can summarise important characteristics of values as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1. Concept of the desirable:</strong> A value always refers to what a person considers <strong>desirable</strong>, not merely what is desired. A person may desire money, but may value honesty more than money.</li>
  <li><strong>2. Have both content and intensity:</strong> <em>Content</em> tells what is important (e.g., honesty, equality), while <em>intensity</em> shows how strongly the person holds that value.</li>
  <li><strong>3. Relatively stable but capable of change:</strong> Values are learned early and become rooted, yet they can slowly change through powerful experiences, education and social influences.</li>
  <li><strong>4. Provide standards for judgement:</strong> Values serve as yardsticks to judge people, actions, ideas and events. For example, an employee who values punctuality dislikes those who frequently come late.</li>
  <li><strong>5. Influence attitudes and behaviour:</strong> Values are more fundamental than attitudes; they shape attitudes, which in turn influence behaviour.</li>
  <li><strong>6. Organised into a value system:</strong> Individuals arrange their values in a <strong>hierarchy of importance</strong>. Some values (like family, religion) are more central, others are peripheral.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Importance of Values in Organisational Behaviour (Brief)</h2>
<p>Values have great significance for managers because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They affect <strong>ethical behaviour</strong> – issues of corruption, fairness, honesty, use of authority.</li>
  <li>They influence <strong>attitudes towards work</strong>, discipline, quality, customer service, etc.</li>
  <li>They affect <strong>leadership style</strong>, decision-making and handling of conflicts.</li>
  <li>They determine how individuals react to organisational policies and change.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sources of Values</h2>
<p>Values are not inborn; they are acquired through a long process of <strong>socialisation and learning</strong>. Various agencies of society contribute to the formation of values. Important sources are discussed below.</p>

<h3>1. Family and Home Environment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>family</strong> is usually the earliest and most powerful source of values.</li>
  <li>Parents, grandparents and other elders constantly convey, through their <strong>speech, behaviour, rewards and punishments</strong>, what is acceptable and what is not.</li>
  <li>Values relating to <strong>truthfulness, respect for elders, obedience, helping others, religious practices, gender roles</strong> etc., are first learned at home.</li>
  <li>A loving and disciplined family tends to develop values such as cooperation, responsibility and self-control, whereas a broken or conflicting family may lead to confusion and negative values.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Religion and Moral Teachings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Religious beliefs, scriptures and moral teachings of different faiths provide powerful standards of <strong>right and wrong</strong>.</li>
  <li>Concepts like honesty, charity, non-violence, tolerance, purity, forgiveness, service to others and respect for life are reinforced through:
    <ul>
      <li>Religious stories and rituals,</li>
      <li>Visits to places of worship,</li>
      <li>Teachings of priests, gurus and spiritual leaders.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Even persons who are not very religious are indirectly influenced by the <strong>moral climate and traditions</strong> of the religion into which they are born.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Culture and Traditions of Society</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Culture</strong> may be defined as the shared beliefs, customs, traditions and ways of life of a society.</li>
  <li>Every culture emphasises certain values as important – e.g., in Indian culture, values like <strong>respect for elders, hospitality, family loyalty, tolerance and spirituality</strong> are strongly emphasised.</li>
  <li>Festivals, rituals, folk tales, proverbs and community practices all act as vehicles for transmitting these cultural values from generation to generation.</li>
  <li>Thus, culture acts as a broad environment within which individual value systems are shaped.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Educational Institutions and Teachers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Schools, colleges and universities are important sources of values beyond the family.</li>
  <li>Through <strong>curriculum, textbooks, classroom discipline, co-curricular activities</strong> and the personal example of teachers, students learn values like:
    <ul>
      <li>Hard work and achievement,</li>
      <li>Teamwork and cooperation,</li>
      <li>Respect for rules and authority,</li>
      <li>Scientific outlook and rational thinking,</li>
      <li>Respect for diversity and democratic values.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Teachers often become <strong>role models</strong> whose conduct strongly influences the moral development of students.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Peer Group and Social Interaction</h3>
<ul>
  <li>As children grow, the influence of <strong>peer group (friends and classmates)</strong> increases.</li>
  <li>To gain acceptance in the group, individuals often adopt the group’s norms and values regarding dress, language, leisure activities, attitudes towards study, authority, etc.</li>
  <li>In later life, colleagues at work, professional associations and trade unions act as peer groups which further influence values related to <strong>work culture, unionism, ethics and loyalty</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Work Organisation and Experience</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The organisation in which a person works is itself a very important source of values.</li>
  <li>Organisational culture, policies and practices repeatedly communicate what is <strong>rewarded and what is discouraged</strong>.</li>
  <li>If honesty, quality, customer orientation and teamwork are rewarded, employees will gradually internalise these as values.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, if only results are rewarded irrespective of means, employees may develop values that justify shortcuts and unethical behaviour.</li>
  <li>Supervisors and top managers, through their own conduct, serve as <strong>value models</strong> for subordinates.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Mass Media and Information Technology</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Modern electronic and print media – television, films, newspapers, magazines, internet, social media – are powerful and increasing sources of values, especially for the younger generation.</li>
  <li>Media continuously presents certain lifestyles, heroes and patterns of success which shape values related to:
    <ul>
      <li>Materialism and consumerism,</li>
      <li>Body image and fashion,</li>
      <li>Gender roles and relationships,</li>
      <li>Political and social issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Media can thus play both a <strong>positive role</strong> (spreading awareness about environment, human rights, national integration) and a <strong>negative role</strong> (glorifying violence, vulgarity and corruption) in value formation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Laws, Political System and National Ideology</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>legal and political framework</strong> of a country also shapes values.</li>
  <li>Constitutional principles like <strong>justice, equality, liberty, secularism and democracy</strong> express the collective values of the nation.</li>
  <li>Through civic education, public debates and institutional practices, citizens develop values of respect for law, tolerance, national integration and social responsibility.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9. Personal Experiences and Self-Reflection</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Individual experiences, successes and failures, rewards and punishments play a major role in strengthening or weakening particular values.</li>
  <li>For example, a person who experiences the benefits of honesty and hard work is likely to deepen his belief in these values.</li>
  <li>Similarly, exposure to injustice, exploitation or discrimination may lead a person to value equality and social reform.</li>
  <li>Through <strong>self-reflection</strong>, reading, counselling and spiritual practices, people sometimes re-examine their earlier values and adopt more mature ones.</li>
</ul>

<h3>10. International Exposure and Global Culture (Brief)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In the era of globalisation, many individuals come into contact with foreign cultures through travel, multinational companies, foreign education and global media.</li>
  <li>This exposure may modify existing values and introduce new values such as <strong>greater individualism, emphasis on human rights, environmental concern, professionalism and quality consciousness</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Managerial Implications of Understanding Sources of Values</h2>
<p>For a manager, knowledge of how values are formed is extremely useful:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It helps in understanding why employees from <strong>different backgrounds</strong> differ in work behaviour and expectations.</li>
  <li>It guides the design of <strong>training, orientation and ethical programmes</strong> to strengthen desired values like integrity, quality and customer orientation.</li>
  <li>It reminds managers that they themselves, as <strong>role models and decision-makers</strong>, are powerful sources of value transmission within the organisation.</li>
</ul>

<p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion.</strong> To conclude, <strong>values</strong> are deep-seated, relatively permanent beliefs about what is desirable or undesirable, right or wrong, which guide human behaviour and evaluation. They form the foundation of attitudes and play a vital role in determining ethical conduct and organisational climate. Values are not inherited; they are acquired from multiple sources such as <strong>family, religion, culture and traditions, educational institutions, peer groups, work organisations, mass media, legal–political system, personal experiences and global exposure</strong>. A clear understanding of these sources enables managers to appreciate diversity in value orientations and to consciously build an organisational culture based on sound, positive values.</p>

  This answer forms part of a carefully curated set of important questions that have frequently appeared in
  past university examinations and therefore hold a high probability of reappearing in future assessments.
  While prepared with academic accuracy and aligned with the standard B.Com (Sem I) syllabus of <em>Psychology for
  Managers</em> (Kalyani Publications — Shashi K. Gupta &amp; Rosy Joshi), these notes should be treated as
  high-quality preparation material rather than a guaranteed prediction of any upcoming exam paper.
