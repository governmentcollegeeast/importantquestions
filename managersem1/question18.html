<p class="question">Q18. What are incentives? Explain various financial and non-financial incentives used to motivate employees in an organisation.</p>

<article>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> In the study of motivation, we have seen that people work in organisations to satisfy a variety of needs – physiological, safety, social, esteem and self-actualisation. Mere existence of needs, however, is not sufficient to secure effective performance. Management has to design and use appropriate <strong>incentives</strong> which link the satisfaction of employee needs with the achievement of organisational goals. From a managerial point of view, incentives are the <strong>practical tools</strong> by which the theories of motivation are converted into day-to-day policies, schemes and facilities. In Psychology for Managers, therefore, a clear understanding of the meaning and types of incentives – both financial and non-financial – is extremely important.</p>

<h2>Meaning of Incentives</h2>
<p>The term <strong>incentive</strong> is derived from the Latin word meaning “to stir up” or “to move”. In management, incentives are the <strong>inducements or rewards</strong> offered to employees to motivate them to work hard, to improve their performance and to remain loyal to the organisation.</p>

<p><strong>Exam-oriented definition:</strong> An incentive may be defined as <strong>any form of monetary or non-monetary reward provided by the organisation to its employees over and above the regular wages and salaries, with the objective of motivating them for better performance, greater effort and positive attitude</strong>.</p>

<p>Thus, incentives are not limited only to money. They cover a wide range of financial and non-financial benefits such as bonus, promotion, recognition, status, participative opportunities and so on.</p>

<h2>Objectives of Incentive System</h2>
<p>The main objectives of providing incentives are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To <strong>attract and retain</strong> competent employees in the organisation.</li>
  <li>To <strong>motivate employees</strong> to put in greater effort and to use their abilities fully.</li>
  <li>To <strong>improve productivity and quality</strong> by linking rewards with performance.</li>
  <li>To <strong>reduce absenteeism, labour turnover and indiscipline</strong>.</li>
  <li>To develop a sense of <strong>belonging, loyalty and commitment</strong> towards the organisation.</li>
  <li>To share the gains of higher efficiency between the organisation and employees in a fair manner.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Classification of Incentives</h2>
<p>From the point of view of Psychology for Managers, incentives can broadly be classified into the following two types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Financial (monetary) incentives</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Non-financial (non-monetary) incentives</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Both types are important. Financial incentives are directly related to money, while non-financial incentives satisfy social, psychological and self-fulfilment needs.</p>

<h2>I. Financial (Monetary) Incentives</h2>
<p><strong>Financial incentives</strong> are those which are measured in terms of money and are provided in addition to the basic wages and salaries. They mainly satisfy <strong>physiological and safety needs</strong> but may also support esteem needs when the amount is significant.</p>

<p>Important financial incentives used in organisations are explained below:</p>

<h3>1. Piece-Rate System</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Under the <strong>piece-rate system</strong>, wages are paid according to the number of units produced or tasks completed, rather than according to time spent.</li>
  <li>The more a worker produces, the higher his earnings will be.</li>
  <li>This system directly links <strong>pay with output</strong> and can motivate employees to increase their productivity, provided the standards are fair and the quality is properly controlled.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Bonus and Profit-Sharing</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bonus</strong> is an extra payment made to employees over and above their normal wages and salaries, often paid annually out of profits or based on productivity indices.</li>
  <li><strong>Profit-sharing</strong> is a more formal scheme under which a fixed portion of the organisation’s profits is distributed among employees according to pre-determined rules.</li>
  <li>These incentives create a feeling that employees are sharing in the <strong>fruits of organisational success</strong> and encourage teamwork and loyalty.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Commission and Sales Incentives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In sales and marketing jobs, employees are often paid a <strong>commission</strong> based on the volume or value of sales.</li>
  <li>Sometimes, special <strong>sales contests</strong> and incentives (such as foreign tours, gifts, additional commissions) are introduced to stimulate extra effort.</li>
  <li>Such schemes strongly motivate salespeople to <strong>increase sales, acquire new customers and open new markets</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Performance-Linked Pay (Incentive Wages)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Under performance-linked pay, a part of the remuneration is directly related to individual or group performance: for example, <strong>productivity-linked dearness allowance (PLDA), key result area (KRA)-based incentives</strong> and other schemes.</li>
  <li>This encourages employees to <strong>set higher goals and improve performance</strong> continuously.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Fringe Benefits (Perquisites)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fringe benefits</strong> are additional financial facilities provided to employees such as provident fund, gratuity, pension, medical reimbursement, subsidised canteen, transport, housing allowance and so on.</li>
  <li>Although these benefits are not directly tied to performance, they increase the overall <strong>economic security and standard of living</strong> of employees, thus indirectly supporting motivation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Retirement Benefits and Social Security</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Provision of <strong>gratuity, pension, group insurance, employees’ state insurance, provident fund and other social security benefits</strong> gives employees a sense of security about their future.</li>
  <li>This satisfies safety needs and builds long-term loyalty to the organisation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Bonus for Suggestions and Cost Saving</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Many organisations introduce <strong>suggestion schemes</strong> where employees are rewarded in cash for ideas that lead to cost reduction, quality improvement or better service.</li>
  <li>This not only provides financial incentives but also encourages creativity and involvement.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Financial incentives are powerful motivators, especially for employees at lower income levels or in early stages of their career. However, they alone are not sufficient. After a certain level, additional money may not significantly increase motivation, and employees start valuing <strong>non-financial incentives</strong> more.</p>

<h2>II. Non-Financial (Non-Monetary) Incentives</h2>
<p><strong>Non-financial incentives</strong> are those incentives which do not involve direct payment of money. They aim at satisfying <strong>social, esteem and self-actualisation needs</strong>. In modern organisations, where employees are better educated and financially reasonably secure, non-financial incentives often play a more important role than purely monetary ones.</p>

<p>Important non-financial incentives are discussed below:</p>

<h3>1. Recognition and Appreciation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Employees have a strong need for <strong>recognition of their work</strong>. Simple acts such as praise in front of colleagues, appreciation letters, awards and certificates can be powerful motivators.</li>
  <li>Public recognition (employee-of-the-month awards, names on honour boards, appreciation in meetings) satisfies <strong>esteem needs</strong> and encourages repetition of good performance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Challenging and Interesting Work</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Meaningful, challenging and varied jobs provide an opportunity for employees to <strong>use their abilities fully</strong>.</li>
  <li>Monotonous, repetitive work leads to boredom and low motivation. On the other hand, enriched jobs which involve problem-solving, decision-making and creativity satisfy <strong>higher-order needs</strong>.</li>
  <li>This connects with Herzberg’s emphasis on “the work itself” as a strong motivator.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Responsibility and Delegation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Granting employees <strong>greater responsibility and authority</strong> over their work acts as a strong non-financial incentive.</li>
  <li>Delegation of decision-making, involvement in planning and autonomy in methods give employees a feeling of <strong>trust and importance</strong>.</li>
  <li>This also supports the Theory Y view that people like to accept and seek responsibility when properly motivated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Participation in Decision-Making</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When employees are allowed to participate in decisions affecting their work – through <strong>joint consultation, committees, quality circles or suggestion schemes</strong> – they feel respected and valued.</li>
  <li>Participation enhances their sense of <strong>ownership and commitment</strong> to organisational goals and reduces resistance to change.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Opportunity for Advancement and Career Growth</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Prospects of <strong>promotion, career progression and personal development</strong> act as long-term motivators.</li>
  <li>Employees are motivated when they see a clear path of advancement based on merit and performance.</li>
  <li>Training, development programmes, job rotation and career planning also contribute to satisfaction of self-actualisation needs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Status and Prestige</h3>
<ul>
  <li>People have a natural desire for <strong>status symbols</strong> which reflect their position in the organisation – such as designation, office size, furniture, company car, separate cabin, special identity card, etc.</li>
  <li>Such symbols satisfy <strong>esteem needs</strong> and communicate recognition of one’s contribution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Job Security</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Although job security ultimately has financial implications, it is also a strong <strong>psychological incentive</strong>.</li>
  <li>Employees who feel secure are more willing to cooperate, to accept responsibilities and to support long-term organisational objectives.</li>
  <li>However, excessive security without performance standards may lead to complacency; therefore, it must be balanced with performance expectations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Good Working Conditions and Work Environment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A clean, safe, healthy and pleasant working environment with adequate lighting, ventilation, welfare facilities and friendly colleagues can significantly improve morale.</li>
  <li>Supportive organisational climate and healthy human relations increase the feeling of <strong>belongingness and satisfaction</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9. Social and Welfare Facilities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Facilities such as <strong>canteen, transport, medical aid, sports and recreation, cultural programmes, educational assistance for children</strong> and so on provide psychological comfort.</li>
  <li>They create a sense that the organisation cares for employees and their families, which enhances <strong>loyalty and attachment</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>10. Praise, Feedback and Counseling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Constructive feedback, guidance and counselling by supervisors help employees improve their performance and solve personal problems.</li>
  <li>Genuine <strong>praise and encouragement</strong> build confidence and motivate employees to maintain high standards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relative Importance of Financial and Non-Financial Incentives</h2>
<p>The motivational power of financial and non-financial incentives is not the same for all employees and in all situations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For employees at lower income levels and in early career stages, <strong>financial incentives</strong> like wages, bonus and allowances are very important as they satisfy basic needs.</li>
  <li>As employees become economically stable and better educated, <strong>non-financial incentives</strong> – recognition, autonomy, responsibility, advancement – become more significant.</li>
  <li>In practice, an effective incentive system must provide an <strong>appropriate combination</strong> of both financial and non-financial incentives, adjusted to the needs of different groups of employees.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidelines for Designing an Effective Incentive System</h2>
<p>From a managerial perspective, the following points are essential for successful use of incentives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Incentives should be <strong>linked to measurable performance</strong> wherever possible, so that employees see a clear connection between effort and reward.</li>
  <li>The incentive scheme should be <strong>fair, transparent and easily understandable</strong>.</li>
  <li>It should be <strong>adequate and attractive</strong> enough to influence behaviour; very small or symbolic incentives have limited effect.</li>
  <li>Different categories of employees may require <strong>different mixes</strong> of incentives according to their needs and job requirements.</li>
  <li>Incentives should be reviewed periodically and adjusted according to changing conditions, inflation and competition.</li>
  <li>Financial incentives must be supported by a positive <strong>organisational culture, supportive leadership and good communication</strong>, otherwise their impact will be reduced.</li>
</ul>

<p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> To sum up, incentives are the concrete tools used by management to motivate employees by linking the satisfaction of their needs with the attainment of organisational goals. They may be <strong>financial</strong> – such as piece-rate wages, bonus, profit-sharing, commission, fringe benefits and social security – or <strong>non-financial</strong> – such as recognition, responsibility, participation, advancement, status, job security and good working conditions. Financial incentives mainly satisfy lower-order needs, while non-financial incentives satisfy higher-order social, esteem and self-actualisation needs. An effective incentive system, therefore, does not rely on money alone but combines both types in a balanced manner, keeping in view the nature of jobs, the level of employees and the economic capacity of the organisation. A wise manager uses incentives judiciously to build a motivated, committed and high-performing workforce.</p>
