<p class="question">Q14. "All illegal agreements are void but all void agreements are not illegal." Explain. </p>

<article>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> Under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, agreements may be unenforceable for several reasons. Two important categories are <strong>illegal agreements</strong> and <strong>void agreements</strong>. While both are unenforceable, they are not identical. All illegal agreements are void, but void agreements are not necessarily illegal. The distinction is crucial to understand the wider legal consequences flowing from illegality.</p>

<h2>Meaning of Illegal Agreements</h2>
<p>An illegal agreement is one where the object or consideration is <strong>forbidden by law</strong>, <strong>fraudulent</strong>, <strong>immoral</strong>, or <strong>opposed to public policy</strong>. Such agreements are not only void but also punishable. They contaminate collateral transactions and are considered criminal or socially harmful.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Agreements to commit theft, smuggling, bribery, trafficking, etc.</p>

<h2>Meaning of Void Agreements</h2>
<p>A void agreement is one that is <strong>not enforceable by law</strong> (Section 2(g)). Void agreements are not punishable and may arise due to incapacity, lack of consideration, uncertainty, or impossibility. They are legally neutral but unenforceable.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Agreements with minors, wagering agreements, agreements without consideration, or agreements in restraint of trade.</p>

<h2>Why All Illegal Agreements Are Void</h2>
<ul>
<li>Illegal agreements violate statutory provisions or public policy and hence cannot be enforced.</li>
<li>Their very object or consideration is unlawful (Section 23).</li>
<li>Court will never assist parties engaged in unlawful acts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, every illegal agreement is void because its formation itself violates law.</p>

<h2>Why All Void Agreements Are Not Illegal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Void agreements may be unenforceable due to technical reasons, not because of illegality.</li>
<li>They do not involve unlawful acts or punishable objects.</li>
<li>Collateral transactions to a void agreement remain valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, void agreements are harmless but unenforceable.</p>

<h2>Key Differences Between Illegal and Void Agreements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nature:</strong> Illegal agreements involve unlawful acts; void agreements are simply unenforceable.</li>
<li><strong>Penalty:</strong> Illegal agreements may be punishable; void agreements carry no penalties.</li>
<li><strong>Collateral transactions:</strong> Invalid in illegal agreements; valid in void agreements.</li>
<li><strong>Scope:</strong> All illegal are void, but some void agreements (e.g., minor's agreement) are not illegal.</li>
<li><strong>Public policy:</strong> Violated only in illegal agreements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Illustrations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Illegal:</strong> A contracts with B to kill C for ₹10,000. The agreement is illegal and void. If B borrows money from D to buy weapons, D’s loan is also void.</li>
<li><strong>Void but not illegal:</strong> A minor borrows money from B. The agreement is void but not illegal. If B borrows from C to lend to the minor, C’s loan is valid.</li>
<li><strong>Another void example:</strong> A agrees to sell goods on a Sunday believing shops cannot open. The agreement is void due to mistake, not illegal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extended Explanation</h2>
<p>Illegal agreements are considered socially dangerous and contrary to the interest of the state. Courts adopt a strict approach toward them to discourage unlawful activities. They taint all related transactions, making them legally unacceptable. On the other hand, void agreements lack enforceability due to legal technicalities but do not harm society. Thus, collateral contracts remain unaffected.</p>
<p>This distinction ensures that parties engaging in unlawful activities receive no legal protection, while those who enter void agreements due to mistake, incapacity, or technical defects are not penalised beyond unenforceability.</p>

<p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Illegal agreements are void because they involve unlawful or harmful acts. Void agreements, however, are not illegal unless they violate law or public policy. The distinction is essential to determine enforceability and the impact on collateral transactions.</p>

  This answer forms part of a carefully curated set of important questions that have frequently appeared in
  past university examinations and therefore hold a high probability of reappearing in future assessments.
  While prepared with academic accuracy and aligned to the prescribed syllabus, these solutions should be
  treated as high-quality preparation material rather than a guaranteed prediction of any upcoming exam paper.
