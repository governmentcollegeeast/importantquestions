<p class="question">Q10. What are the remedies available for breach of contract?</p>

<article>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> When a party fails to perform their contractual obligations, a breach of contract occurs. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides several legal remedies to the aggrieved party. These remedies aim to compensate, enforce performance, or restore the injured party to the position they would have been in had the contract been performed. Courts ensure that breach does not leave the injured party without adequate redress.</p>

<h2>1. Suit for Damages (Section 73–75)</h2>
<p>Damages are the most common remedy. The objective is not to punish the defaulting party but to compensate the injured party for the actual loss suffered.</p>
<h3>(a) Ordinary Damages</h3>
<p>These arise naturally from the breach and are awarded to place the injured party in the original financial position.</p>
<h3>(b) Special Damages</h3>
<p>These are awarded only when special circumstances were communicated to the defaulting party at the time of contract.</p>
<h3>(c) Exemplary/Punitive Damages</h3>
<p>Awarded in exceptional cases such as breach of promise to marry or wrongful dishonour of cheque.</p>
<h3>(d) Nominal Damages</h3>
<p>Granted when breach occurs but no real loss is suffered. They establish the plaintiff’s right.</p>
<h3>(e) Liquidated Damages and Penalty</h3>
<p>If the contract specifies a sum payable on breach, courts may award reasonable compensation not exceeding that sum.</p>

<h2>2. Suit for Specific Performance (Specific Relief Act)</h2>
<p>Instead of compensation, the court may order the defaulting party to perform the contract exactly as promised. This remedy is used when damages are inadequate, such as contracts involving:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sale of immovable property</li>
<li>Unique goods</li>
<li>Contracts requiring precise performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific performance ensures that the injured party receives the exact benefit promised.</p>

<h2>3. Suit for Injunction</h2>
<p>An injunction is a court order directing a party to do or not to do something. It prevents breach or stops continuation of breach. Types include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prohibitory Injunction:</strong> Prevents a party from performing a wrongful act.</li>
<li><strong>Mandatory Injunction:</strong> Compels undoing a wrongful act.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a singer contracted to perform exclusively for A cannot perform for B; courts may restrain her by injunction.</p>

<h2>4. Rescission of Contract (Section 39)</h2>
<p>The aggrieved party may cancel the contract when the other party refuses or fails to perform. Once rescinded, both parties are discharged from future obligations. The injured party may also claim compensation for any loss suffered.</p>

<h2>5. Restitution (Section 75)</h2>
<p>When a contract is rescinded, the party who received any benefit must restore it to the other party. Restitution ensures that no party is unjustly enriched.</p>

<h2>6. Quantum Meruit</h2>
<p>Meaning “as much as earned,” this remedy allows a party to claim reasonable payment for the part of work performed before breach. It applies when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contract becomes impossible</li>
<li>One party prevents the other from completing the contract</li>
<li>Contract is divisible and part performance is accepted</li>
</ul>
<p>This prevents unjust enrichment and ensures fairness.</p>

<h2>7. Suit for Injured Party’s Price (Action for Price)</h2>
<p>In contracts of sale of goods, if ownership has passed to the buyer but the buyer refuses to pay, the seller may sue for the contract price.</p>

<h2>8. Cancellation of Instrument</h2>
<p>If a written contract is void or voidable, courts may order it to be cancelled to avoid future legal complications.</p>

<h2>Extended Explanation</h2>
<p>These remedies collectively provide a comprehensive mechanism to uphold rights and ensure justice. The law aims not only to compensate financially but also to enforce performance, prevent future breach, and maintain integrity in contractual relationships. The choice of remedy depends on the nature of the breach, kind of contract, and adequacy of compensation.</p>
<p>Damages remain the most common remedy, but equitable remedies like specific performance or injunctions are vital in cases involving unique subject matter. Quantum meruit and restitution ensure fairness even when contracts are partially performed or discharged.</p>

<p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Indian Contract Act provides multiple remedies such as damages, specific performance, injunction, rescission, restitution, and quantum meruit. These remedies protect the injured party and maintain fairness, ensuring that contractual obligations are not violated without consequence.</p>
